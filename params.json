We have run an analytical process on the course database to help give you, the students at DTU, a better (and visually stimulating) overwiew of what courses are relevant for you. Simultatiously, you will learn some new things about the courses at DTU such as how they are connected, what each department focues on, and much more.\r\n\r\nTo view the whole analysis including the scripts and outcomes you can view the [explainer notebook in jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/blob/master/explainer_notebook-Final.ipynb).\r\n\r\n\r\n###1. Project Description\r\n#### Overview of DTU Course Base\r\nThis project for the Social graphs and Interactins at DTU concerns creating an improved overview for students to use. As a new student at DTU (especially if you are new on the masters) one of the first things you are asked to do is choosing which courses you wish to attend for a semester. There are studieplans in existence but some students might want to have a more customized study plan where they can choose courses they feel are most relevant to themselves.\r\n\r\nSo, the data that this project concerns itself with is data that can be scraped from the course database on DTU's website. The pages for each course contain information about Course number, Course name, Course responsible (teachers), Content, Learning objectives, Recommended prerequisites (other courses that should have been attended before attending a specific course), and much more. The search engine in the course database allows the user to filter their search for specific courses by study department which is how the course pages were segmented when we scraped the data. \r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Data Collection\r\n#### Scraping the Data\r\nThe first and most crucial part of this project was scraping (i.e. retrieving) the information of each course from the course database. The content of the course pages were retrived and structured segmentatiously by deparment taking advantage of the course base filter by department.Thereafter, it was matter of structuring this retrieved data, so it could become easily readible.\r\n\r\nDue to some irregularities with the data formatting on the webpages in the DTU coure base, some minor manual clean-ups where neccessary in order to make the further compuations go more smoothly.\r\n\r\n_Transposed image of how the complete dataframe looked like. In this alternate case each category of information is a row and each course is a column:_\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpage%20for%20social%20graph%20study/table.JPG\" class=\"inline\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### 3. Analysis of Course Network\r\n\r\n#### Network of courses by recommended prerequisites\r\nThe first approach to handling the data was to create an overall network of all the courses found in the database. The link/connection between the courses would be based on their recommended prerequisites that could be find on each page. The references to other courses in recommended prerequisites were based on course numbers which simplified the network \r\ngeneration method, especially by using the networkx library in Python. \r\n\r\n_That network looks like this:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/course_networ_req.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nAfter generating the network, it is advantageous to utilize networkx to do some network analysis that would be telling of the relationship between courses and lead to interesting regarding the courses. \r\nTo get an overall intrepetation of the network, utilizing degree distrubution is advantageous.\r\n\r\n_The degree distrubution:_\r\n![Degree_dist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/Degree-distrubution.png)\r\n\r\nIt can be seen in the plot that a majority of the nodes have degree 1 and the number of them is decreasing with higher degree. This can be interpreted  as a graph/netowkr with a lot of single nodes connected to one big cluster. We can also see that there is not a single node with a degree 0 which means that if we pick every single node there is always a path to all nodes in the network from that node.\r\n\r\nIn this case we calculated the in-degrees and out-degrees, plotted it against each other, and eventually isolated outliers in that plot. The outliers would correspond to courses with a big disperatity between in-degrees and out-degrees with respect to out-degrees as the higher value. From an analytical standpoint this would indicate which courses are the most infuential on other courses around, so it would be courses that student's should strongly consider taking as they are of importance. \r\n\r\n\r\n_Firstly, is the barplot of the in-degrees and out-degrees:_\r\n![bar_plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/bar_plots_of_degrees.png)\r\n\r\n_And the subsequent scatterplot:_\r\n![scatter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/scatter_plot.png)\r\n\r\n_From the notebook:_\r\nThe top outliers in the scatterplot in descending order was the courses of:\r\n\r\n* Course number:  11080  has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 15\r\n* Course number:  42086  has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 11\r\n* Course number:  62193  has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 11\r\n* Course number:  62233  has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 22\r\n* Course number:  02526 has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 14\r\n* Course number:  30740  has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 11\r\n* Course number:  41663 has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 13\r\n* Course number:  30742  has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 11\r\n* Course number:  11375  has ingoing degree 0 and outdoing degree 12\r\n\r\nWe also looked into in-degree and out-degree centralities in the same procedure. These values tells us specifically  the fraction of nodes its incoming and outcoming edges are connected to respectively i.e. the higher the value the more connected a node is the more importance it has to its associates. The nature of the relationship in terms on who is dependent on who is denoted by wheter it is out-degree or in-degree.\r\nThe top outlier in this plot was:\r\n\r\n_The scatter plot of degree centralities:_\r\n![deg_cen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/scatter_plot_cen.png)\r\n\r\n_The outliers i.e. most influental courses ranked in descending order:_\r\n* Course number:  11080  has ingoing degree 0.0 and outdoing degree 0.00619322873658\r\n* Course number:  62233  has ingoing degree 0.0 and outdoing degree 0.00908340214699\r\n* Course number:  02526 has ingoing degree 0.0 and outdoing degree 0.00578034682081\r\n* Course number:  41663 has ingoing degree 0.0 and outdoing degree 0.00536746490504\r\n* Course number:  02343 has ingoing degree 0.000825763831544 and outdoing degree 0.00536746490504\r\n\r\nLikewise, we did eigenvalue centrality to review which courses where most popular in regards to other high-degree courses i.e. the most important courses among important courses, which denoted the results.\r\n_The outliers of the eigenvalue centrality i.e. the most influental courses amongst important courses ranked in descending order:_\r\n\r\n* Course number:  62583  has ingoing degree 0.0 and outdoing degree 0.356957549843\r\n* Course number:  02368 has ingoing degree 0.0 and outdoing degree 0.410986298529\r\n* Course number:  62584  has ingoing degree 0.0 and outdoing degree 0.356957549843\r\n\r\nWe also looked into the highest beweenness centrality which were indicators of a large influence on the transfer of items (student) through the network of courses, under the assumption that item transfer follows the shortest paths i.e. the overall most important (or in this case neccessary) course.\r\n\r\n_The most important courses ranked in descending order:_\r\n* '02131', 9.635616786915753e-06\r\n* '41511', 9.692464083593721e-06\r\n* '41560', 1.210847419240741e-05\r\n* '02402', 1.2148267300081986e-05\r\n* '41704', 1.7054189003390714e-05\r\n* '41401', 1.790689845356025e-05\r\n* '41502', 2.4629091285730088e-05\r\n* '41612', 2.489911594495044e-05\r\n* '01035', 3.510320569864589e-05\r\n* '41501', 6.733562291505434e-05\r\n\r\nIn regards to the shortest path we also tested out a hypothesis that states that DTU contain more base courses denoted by courses (nodes) that have the shortest path lenghts than courses that have longer shortest path lengths (advanced courses).\r\n\r\n_A graph showing the frequency of shortest path lenghts:_\r\n![lenght_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/lenght_graph.png)\r\n\r\nThe last part of our analysis work of the network was identifiying the communities that could be found within it. The interesting aspect of this is that that we supposedly already now the communities (i.e. departments) but the network analyis tools like the louvain-algorithm might denote a different outcome. This could be telling us about how well the distrubution of courses between departments is actually. \r\n\r\n_The network with communities illustrated by color:_\r\n![com_netw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/communities_graph.png)\r\n\r\nFirstly, we calculate the the assortativity of the undirected graph as a negative value ( -0.0667934917309). The negative value indicate that smiliar high-degree (important) courses do not show a  tendency to link to other high-degree nodes(courses).\r\nLastly, we calculate the modularity as it can be compared to the modularity (0.8053529955) of the actual communities (decided by departments) later.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAnother network was made using the pre-requisites but this version set the actual communities denoted by departments.\r\n\r\n_The course network colored by departments:_\r\n![color_net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/colored_network_communities.png)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, networks for each department was created in order to calculate each department's (community) modularity to then collect at have a signle modularity value for the whole network [Networks for each department](https://github.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/tree/master/new_final_pic). \r\nThe overall modularity for the actual communities were 0.4492397651481369. The disparity(the other modularity is higher) between modularity values indicate that the departments are not the best way of defining the communities. \r\nThe modularity of the communities of the undirected version of the department based network was also higher (0.6853537981269512). \r\n\r\n_The simplified colored network for courses by departments:_\r\n![color_netw_s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/department_fig.png)\r\n\r\nOverall departments can't be considered good communities, so the student has to think beyond his/her department when choosing courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. Analysis of Teachers Network\r\n#### Network of teachers across departments\r\nIt can be argued that the teacher is the most important component of a course as without the teacher it would just be a room of students sitting and playing on their computers. The scraped data that was structured in dataframes (and exported as csv files) opens a lot of oppertunities of analysis on the course database. \r\nThe particular analysis in this section is about identifying the interdisciplinary connections between departments based on similar teachers e.g. which departments are mostly connected by having the same teacher, which crossover to each other etc.\r\nWith a few trick this was visualized using networkx\r\n\r\n_The teachers network across departments:_\r\n![teacher network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/webpageimages/teacher_network.png)\r\n\r\nAt a first glance the network shows interesting results such as teachers being between networks and departments that are completely isolated(department of vetenarians). But as expected their a lot of interdisciplinary connections across departments. \r\n\r\nBy using the betweennees centrality we can rank the connectivity to other departments of each department illustrate what can be anticipated by glancing at the network:\r\n\r\n_The department ranked by betweenness in descending order in ther teacher's network:_\r\n\r\n\r\n* Department-of-Mechanical-Engineering.csv 0.331165165718\r\n* Department-of-Applied-Mathematics-and-Computer-Science.csv 0.255187245052\r\n* DTU-Management-Engineering.csv 0.241006773754\r\n* DTU-Diplom.csv 0.233125365989\r\n* Department-of-Micro-and-Nanotechnology.csv 0.182001269013\r\n* Department-of-Electrical-Engineering.csv 0.16419889873\r\n* Department-of-Civil-Engineering.csv 0.162682889437\r\n* Department-of-Environmental-Engineering.csv 0.156865813099\r\n* Department-of-Chemical-Engineering.csv 0.146487264041\r\n* Department-of-Systems-Biology.csv 0.11884569099\r\n* Department-of-Photonics-Engineering.csv 0.105719545961\r\n* Department-of-Physics.csv 0.104769397632\r\n* National-Food-Institute.csv 0.0766515133072\r\n* DTU.csv 0.0699286991041\r\n* DTU-Wind-Energy.csv 0.0674661726089\r\n* National-Institute-of-Aquatic-Resources.csv 0.0663865135928\r\n* National-Space-Institute.csv 0.0442311853822\r\n* Department-of-Chemistry.csv 0.0414120573771\r\n* Other-courses.csv 0.0398747557566\r\n* Department-of-Transport.csv 0.0018662155081\r\n* National-Veterinary-Institute.csv 0.000162746153557\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5. Analysis of the Course content\r\n#### Wordcloud illustration of most used terms in each study department\r\nIn cases where students have a proximate idea of what they want their courses to contain it could be useful for them to narrow down which department best represents that. Each course page contain a content page that normally has keywords that are representative of what they are about. Using wordclouds to represent which terms/words are weighted most in each department would be a good tool for that.These wordclouds are interesting indicators for what is weighted more in each department. This can be useful for student who are not sure of which education they want or which department of education they mostly relate too. Having a list (or a visual stimulating cloud) of terms can help narrow down that search e.g. a studen who wants his education to weight on economy could search for department wordcloud that majorily (size-wise) contain the word \"economy\"(or similar) and finds his/her education within it.\r\n\r\n_The collection of wordclouds_:\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Systems-Biology:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Systems-Biology.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Electrical-Engineering:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Electrical-Engineering.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Applied-Mathematics-and-Computer-Science:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics-and-Computer-Science.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Transport:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Transport.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Micro-and-Nanotechnology:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Micro-and-Nanotechnology.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_National-Institute-of-Aquatic-Resources.csv:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/National-Institute-of-Aquatic-Resources.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Physics:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Physics.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Photonics-Engineering:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Photonics-Engineering.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_DTU:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/DTU.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_National-Food-Institute:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/National-Food-Institute.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_National-Veterinary-Institute:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/National-Veterinary-Institute.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Other-courses:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Other-courses.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_DTU-Management-Engineering:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/DTU-Management-Engineering.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Chemistry:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Chemistry.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Chemical-Engineering:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Chemical-Engineering.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_DTU-Wind-Energy:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/DTU-Wind-Energy.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n_National-Space-Institute:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/National-Space-Institute.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_DTU-Diplom:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/DTU-Diplom.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Mechanical-Engineering:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Mechanical-Engineering.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Civil-Engineering:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Civil-Engineering.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n_Department-of-Environmental-Engineering:_\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam1511/Social_Graph_Project_Final_2016/master/wordclouds/Department-of-Environmental-Engineering.csv.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n###6.
