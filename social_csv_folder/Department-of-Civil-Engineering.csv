participating universities with a strong engineering and business
related background, which gets completed by the HCU with a more
sociological background. Further, several private companies from
consultancy and city development (e.g. Rambøll, By&Havn, etc.)
are involved in the course. Hence, the students will learn to work
on the interdisciplinary challenge of sustainable urban structures
with colleagues from different disciplines and with other
problem-solving approaches.

business, local governments and citizens Assess new technologies and models for sustainable change Identify the interdependencies, actors and networks of the
chosen urban challenge Establish connections between technological state-of-the-art
solutions and their use in a planning, commercial and user-related
context Evaluate the scope of potential solutions that help tackle the
chosen urban challenge Evaluate the viability of potential solutions that help tackle
the chosen urban challenge Uncover potential innovative business opportunities for
tackling the chosen urban challenge Work alongside leading companies who are actively seeking to
make lasting changes within cities","
Students will conduct a comparative analysis of HafenCity in
Hamburg and Nordhavn in Copenhagen contextualizing both districts
within the larger development patterns of the metro-regions of
Hamburg and Copenhagen and in contrast to a selection of other
cases. Assessing the role of the districts within the larger
context will enable students to identify drivers within private,
public, and non-profit activities that could enhance the districts
and cities ability to address technological, economic and social
challenges in a sustainable manner. The solutions may include for
instance smart energy technologies, public policy changes, new
business models, infrastructure projects or citizen involvement.

 Guiding questions for the course are the following:

• What technological solutions are needed for a sustainable urban
agglomerations and how to implement these in specific contexts?

• How do we make decisions in cities while considering global
challenges such as immigration, climate change, and growing income
disparities?

• How supportive are our government policies and relationships with
investors, technology enterprises, utilities and citizens to meet
these challenges?

• What are the agents of change and who is leading the way?

• How do NGO’s and citizens gain legitimacy and influence local
city governments?

Main academic issues addressed during the course are:

• Climate mitigation and adaptation strategies in the urban context

• Sustainable urbanizations and integrated design

• Complexity of interdisciplinarity, localization and globalization

• Urban governance forms (public, private, and crossover forms)

• Business and political ethics

• Business innovation and entrepreneurship

processes are typically centrally involved. The transport processes
both comprise moisture transport and transport of other matters,

used computational tools for fire and evacuation modeling and their
possible integration in relation to fire safety design.

A student who has met the course objectives, is expected to be able
to: 
","list the main types of numerical models for pre- and
post-flashover fire explain the main set of equations and the main solution methods
of CFD programs explain the phenomena influencing evacuation and the analytical
and empirical formula describing them explain the main differences between CFD and evacuation
modeling programs and their possible integration implement the
necessary sensitivity analyses on the basis of the main model
assumptions identify the main input parameters in FDS and STEPS highlight the main uncertainties in fire and evacuation models
and implement the necessary sensitivity analyses to run analyses in FDS and STEPS and interpret the
outcomes recognize the main assumptions of the fire and evacuation
models and the limits of validity of the results","
The course is organized in three parts, following the schedule of
the classes in three modules of 9h each and focusing on: i) fire
modeling; ii) evacuation modeling; and iii) integration between the
two.

In the first and second modules the main theoretical aspects
related to computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and evacuation
algorithms will be presented, respectively. The syntax of FDS as
CFD program and of STEPS as evacuation program will be introduced
and some simple models will be implemented. The simulations will be
aimed at highlighting some critical aspects of the modeling, such
as validation of the model, objectivity of the solution and
sensitivity to uncertainties.

As home assignment at the end of the first module, the students
will be asked to create a FDS model capable of simulating the smoke
development in a building fire of given characteristics and
summarize the main assumptions and results in a short report. A
similar homework will be carried out at the end of the second
module with respect to an evacuation simulation in the same
building with STEPS. The two exercises on fire and evacuation
modeling will not be graded, but their submission before the start
of the following module is required in order to be admitted to the
examination.

In the third module, the home assignments will be corrected and the
main critical aspects of the modeling will be discussed with more
detail. Few more advanced functions of FDS and STEPS will be
introduced and the interaction between fire modeling and evacuation
modeling will be presented. A final assignment will be given to the
students in the form of an integrated design problem based on the
fire and evacuation models implemented in the two previous home
assignments.

The final models and results should be described in a detailed
report to be submitted after the end of the third module. The
evaluation of the final report will serve for the grading of the
students.
