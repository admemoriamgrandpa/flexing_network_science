Human-Centered Innovation/Design. User research and -tests are a
central theme.

We will also be discussing processes and how focus on the process
can improve the final result.

The cource also gives an introduction to study techniques, academic
writing and arguments.

Central for the course is a Design Thinking group project through
which the students find a user need or a problem to create a simple
prototype of a solution for.

The students have to learn to do qualitative observations and
interviews, and they have to analyse and turn findings into concept
ideas.

The concept and prototype is then developed through an iterative
proces, alternating between Development and user tests. It requires
the students to learn to make quick sketches and obtain early user
feedback.

In the last part of the semester, when the final concept is done,
the students will be introduced to a number of concepts and
positions of ethics that they have to apply in a reflection on
their solution.

The student will be required to read a fair amount of relevant
texts that they have to use in their reports

The exam will be a port folio of a number of reports written during
the course. Each report will have an equal ration of the final
mark.´

Psychology - is the scientific study of human behavior and mental
processes, including humans capability to react and act. Mental
processes include will, emotions and thinking (cognitive
behavioral).

Sociology - is the study of society, their structures, organization
and importance to the individuals that are part of a society. This
course is based on the sociological structures that affect the
implementation of technology.

Ethics - is about what we should do as individuals and as a
society. Ethics dictate parts of human actions. The course presents
different kinds of ethical considerations, which the
Healthtechnologists experience in practice.

Communication - can be defined as the total verbal and non-verbal
interaction between individuals and between individuals in
organizations.

Pedagogy - in this course, is a scientific approach to training and
education of humans, including consulting roles and tools to target
learning to specific reciever groups.

processes with many unknown factors.

Here is a chance to work with real challenges provided by companies
which must be solved interdisciplinary.

factors. Analyse and manage uncertainty and complexity of the project,
including the dynamics of interaction between stakeholders,
partners and project participants, and be able to argue for the
inclusion and exclusion made in the project. Use their own as well as other’s skills, preferences and
potential in an interdisciplinary project. In addition, be able to
argue for major decisions, put in relation to both own and other’s
skills. See own role and cooperation of the team in a meta perspective,
to understand how the team communicates, plan, decide, solve
problems, handle disagreements and deal with professional and
personal differences. Describe and reflect on an innovation process, own and
other’s' roles in this, and relate this and gained experiences
to the course theory of innovation and interdisciplinary
collaboration.","
You get to work with a problem from a business that requires a new
solution where technology and technical development play a central
role. The theory is taught primarily via an e-learning module so
that the course days will be used to apply the theory in practice.
The knowledge that you gain in the e- learning module is included
in the final assessment.

Fundamental to the process is a business perspective on the complex
engineering problems. Considerations are made on users, technology,
design, sustainability, market, society and economy when the
project is driven forward. Enterprising, innovative and agile
methods are matched with traditional engineering development and
create an efficient development process.

The course ends with an innovation presentation and a prototype of
engineering quality that form part of the final grading. Each team
member is responsible for decisions throughout the project.
Likewise, how you reflect on the process and how that team has
managed to bring each other's skills play a part.

In This course you have the opportunity to challenge yourself and
manoeuvre in unfamiliar processes. You will engange in work with
other disciplines and learn to cooperate across studylines. You
will get to work with a company and be responsible to deliver on
agreed milestones to both your team and the company.
