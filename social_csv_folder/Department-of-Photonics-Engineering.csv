The theory of optics is so rich and complex that many theoretical
formalisms have been formulated to describe, analyze, simulate and
quantify its physical properties. Among all these formalisms
phenomenological approaches like radiometry and radiative transfer,
originally stated in the context of astrophysics, are very
convenient and widely used to simulate light propagation and
light-matter interactions. Phenomenon like scattering of light by a
random media or rough surface are well explained by radiative
transfer theory, as well as macroscopic light-matter interactions
through the concept of bi-scattering-distribution-function (BSDF).
In this course, we will give significant theoretical and practical
insights of this theory, which is of particular importance of many
fields of science and engineering. 
","• Analyze and characterize optical properties of materials
important for light transport • Model, derive, measure and efficiently utilize
bi-scattering-distribution-functions • Manipulate and solve the integral equations governing light
transport in both scalar and vector forms • Simulate and model light transport and light-matter
interactions for engineering and scientific applications from
optical engineering to astrophysics • Predict and solve the (multiple/single) scattering of light
by random scatterers, both in volume and surface • Derive mathematical and numerical models for light transport
modeling and simulation • Describe and interpret the principles of optical simulation
software and raytracing based algorithms • Conduct numerical simulations for solving complex light
transport and light matter interaction problems, without directly
solving PDEs like Maxwell’s or Wave equations • Derive analytical solutions of Maxwell’s equations","
The course consists of four parts:

1. Review of theory of optics

2. Radiative transfer equation (RTE): theory and applications

3. Light scattering and bi-directional scattering functions

4. Numerical methods and algorithms for solving the RTE and
scattering problems

We will start from reviewing electromagnetic and wave approaches of
principles of optics, and related mathematical concepts. This part
will also review optical properties of materials; this will be
useful for the modelling and simulation of light transport
problems.

In a second part of the course, we will depart from Maxwell’s and
wave equations to derive the radiative transfer equation, which is
based on geometrical optics but can fully embrace waves optics
properties like polarization. In this part of the course, we will
also discuss integral equations, as the RTE is part of this class
of equations; other integral equations that will be discussed
include Kirchhoff and Stratton-Chu integrals.

Then equipped with the theoretical foundation of radiative transfer
and integral equations we will approach the problem of light
scattering and explain it through the RTE formalism. In this part,
we will also introduce the concept of
bi-scattering-distribution-function (BSDF). Polarization will be
also discussed in this section, and we will see how to include it
in a ray-based theory through Stokes formalism and vector integral
equations. Based on understanding of the theoretical aspects of
radiative transfer we will learn to solve integral equations with
raytracing and Monte Carlo methods, and present some commercial and
open source simulation packages based on these techniques.

1. Review of Fourier methods and wave physics for optical imaging

2. Image processing, display and acquisition technologies

3. Spectroscopy

4. Harmonic analysis methods for imaging

5. Sparse recovery, image reconstruction, inverse problems and
compressive imaging

We will start from reviewing Fourier analysis and wave imaging for
optical imaging, and their underlying mathematical theories.
Thereafter imaging methods based on coherence of waves, diffraction
or polarization will be addressed.

We will then discuss image processing, with an emphasis on
denoising and edge preservation, and describe the functional
principles of display and sensing device like cameras and related
sensors technologies (CMOS, CCD). In this part of the course, we
will also tackle the problem of high dynamic range images, in both
acquisition and display applications.

After the review of fundamental of imaging and Fourier methods, we
will address spectroscopy in both its physical and imaging
concepts.

The last part of the course will be fully dedicated to advanced and
novel concepts, grounded in harmonic analysis and optimization,
leveraging limitation of traditional imaging methods that the first
part of the course addresses. In a first step, the theory of
harmonic analysis, applied to imaging, will be introduced. Then the
theoretical foundation of Compressive sensing, sparse and inverse

spectroradiometry and colorimetry","
The course consists of four parts:

1.Photonic devices for power generation.

2.Light emitting diodes for solid state illumination.

3.Light management for maximum efficiency.

4.Solid state illumination.

We start from presenting the principle of operation of photovoltaic
devices including analysis of their ideal power conversion
efficiency. We will then discuss the performance of the real
devices and analyse the factors limiting their efficiency compared
with the ideal case. Various technologies (present and future) and
materials will be included in comparison.

In a second part of the course we will discuss specific issues of
design and operation of light emitting diodes needed for solid
state illumination. Materials and strategies for achieving high
efficiency and high power of emission at visible light wavelengths
will be analysed. Future trends in this rapidly changing subject
will be presented as well as the current ones.

Light management in both types of devices is a key element for
achieving high efficiency. Optics, micro-optics and chip level
strategies for efficient light coupling into the photovoltaic
devices and light out-coupling from the LEDs will be discussed.
Modelling of optical components of the systems will be included.

Based on understanding both the LEDs and optics we will present
strategies for white light generation used in solid state
illumination. The students will have the opportunity to learn about
photometry, which analyses light as seen by human eye and about
colour measurement.

The course aims to create the opportunity for students with
different academic orientation (CBS, DTU) to work together
developing commercialization strategies for technologies that are
created in university laboratories.

The course is very hands business development focusing on practical
real life testing of assumptions about selected solutions.

The course will introduce students to theories, models and tools
that are central to the identification, development and
commercialization of new technologies. It will draw from
entrepreneurship, economic, management, marketing, organization and
strategy. Key concepts of entrepreneurship and innovation will be
merged to create a cohesive course content to include how to
efficiently and effectively evaluate promising technologies to
determine their commercial potential.

For students with no business background, there will be online
crash course in business and entrepreneurship offered in a week
before the course starts. 
","Evaluate a technology case to identify business/commercial
potential Identify strengths and weaknesses in different application of
the technology and select the best business case Design an appropriate business model for the chosen product,

The interest for applications of coherent light and optical sensing
in biology and medicine has been increasing the past years. This is
partly due to the development of new laser systems, partly the
development in optical systems and finally advances in precise and
non-invasive diagnostics and analyses. The course is divided into
three areas: 1) Light sources for medical diagnostics and
treatment, 2) light-tissue interactions, and 3) Optical methods for
bio-imaging. 
","Discuss basic optical principles like coherence, interference
and diffraction, and determine imaging properties of simple rays in
spherical lenses and mirrors. Explain the principle of laser action and understand the mode
of operation of the various components in different laser
systems. Discuss the physics behind nonlinear frequency conversion, and
describe tuning properties of coherent light sources based on
nonlinear frequency conversion. Explain different light-tissue interactions, e.g.:
Photochemical, thermal, photo induced plasma and photo ablation,
and be able to relate these interactions to the characteristics of
the light source. Discuss the optical properties of tissue (scattering and
absorption) and the wavelength dependencies of these
processes. Describe the principle of transport theory and knowledge of
solutions, including diffusion theory. Apply the principle of Monte Carlo simulations as a general
solution and understand how this method can be used to solve
transport theory of light propagation in scattering media. Explain and discuss the functionality of a specific optically
based diagnostic system, OCT, and two-photon microscopy Describe spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence,
two-photon microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, and understand the
basic operation and limitations of a spectrometer. Orally present scientific papers within the areas of the course
and discuss results.","
The lectures will cover the biological and medical background for
application of light for treatment and diagnosis, especially
propagation of light in human tissue, interaction between light and
tissue, possibilities for therapy with light and imaging methods.
An important topic is the optical properties of the eye: Spectral
properties, fluorescence of the various parts of the eye, optical
diagnostics by scattered light within the eye, properties of the
retina and possibilities for healing by optical treatment. Further,
modern coherent light sources will be covered such as the optical
properties of laser beams, different laser systems and their
potential for bio-medical applications. Throughout the course
examples and external visits will be used whenever possible.
