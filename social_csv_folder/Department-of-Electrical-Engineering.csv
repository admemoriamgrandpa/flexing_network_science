The course deals with novel control methods and concepts in the
area of robust and optimal control, fault diagnosis and fault
tolerant control.

Robust and optimal control are applied where the controller need to
be independend of variations in the control object, i.e. the effect
from the variations on the performance is minimal. Fault diagnosis
is applied for detection and/or isolating faults in dynamical
systems. Faults can e.g. be a sensor break down, a valve is not
working optimal etc. Fault diagnosis is applied for supervision of
dynamical systems in connection with fault tolerant control. When a
major changes happen in the control object or in the controller due
to e.g. faults in the system, it can be necessary to make changes
in the controller/control architecture to avoid undesired stop of
production, break down or safety hazards. This can be done in a
systematic way by using fault tolerant control, where the control
system is reconfigured or the control object is closed down in a
safe way.

The first part of the course include an introduction to the other
parts of the course.

Both analysis and design methods will be presented, the
participants will work actively with analysis and design and real
application cases are used to illustrate the concepts. Particants

constitutive equations which in conjunction form the basis of all

tissue materials. The elastic materials will include both isotropic
and anisotropic materials in order to understand the mechanical
behavior of blood vessels and bones. Visco-elastic material laws
will be applied to model tendons and cartilage.

We will read and discuss scientific papers describing biomechanical
analysis of vertical jumping and the biomechanics of large tendons
to provide you with insight into how research is performed within
these areas.

The course also incorporates experimental work, where you will
collect data to analyze a given biomechanical problem set-up. We
will perform two kinds of tests: Measurement of forces and moments
on the hip joint during a vertical jump, and tension test of a
large tendon.

During the course you will be given time to perform finite element

you have collected the necessary experimental data in the

31920 , Communicating Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering,English , 5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,Spring  or  Fall,Ph.D.,Department of Electrical Engineering,"
The goal of this course is to help train participants in rhetorical
skills to communicate advanced topics and technical material to a
broad scientific audience and industry in English language.
Participants will gain experience in presenting their research
project in a broad context by giving talks, poster presentations,
and the preparation and peer-review of written articles on a
professional level. These skills will benefit participants in their
future careers regardless of whether they stay in academia or work
in industry. A further goal is to give participants the experience
of reflecting on their work from an outside perspective, with the
goal to provide a deeper understanding for the audience and reader.

","Utilize professional rhetorical and presentation skills to
present complex technical and scientific concepts via oral and
poster presentations Judge content and level of detail appropriate for different
lengths of presentations Extract and present core elements of complex technical and
scientific concepts Write accessible and relevant publications for a target
audience outside one’s own field Analyze complex topics based on a short presentation Communicate constructive criticism outside one’s own field Receive and respond to constructive criticism in dialogue and
written form Characterize the relevance of one’s own PhD project to the
broader scientific community and with respect to industry Anticipate diverse educational backgrounds in the presentation
of complex technical and scientific topics","
Students enrolled in the course must participate in the 3 core
activities of the course:

1. Weekly Seminar Series (whole year, fall and spring terms)

The weekly seminar consists of talks given by Ph.D. students.
During their 30-min talk, students present their thesis research to
the target audience (colleagues with an engineering background) so
that the audience can follow the main scientific and technical
arguments. Students enrolled in the course are expected to present
and provide constructive feedback on other presentations submitted
using an online form. Students will also receive constructive
feedback from the audience and VIP staff immediately following
their talk in a plenary discussion.

2. Annual Conference

Students enrolled in the course are expected to present a poster of
their thesis work at an annual conference organized by DTU
Electrical Engineering for industry. Due to the broad scope of the
conference, the students are required to present their work in the
same accessible, but still scientific form as in the oral seminar
presentation.

3. Magazine Article

Students will write an article about their research that is aimed
at communicating their thesis work to a defined target audience.
The article will conform to a set of pre-defined style and space
requirements and be submitted for peer-review from other students
for constructive feedback. Revised and accepted articles will be
published in the department’s online resources and/or in a
department published periodical (e.g., as a supplement to DTU in
profile or DTU Avisen, or as a stand-alone journal). Selected
articles will be edited and published on a science-related news
website (e.g., www.videnskab.dk or www.nordiscience.com).
