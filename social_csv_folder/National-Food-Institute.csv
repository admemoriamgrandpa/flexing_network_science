operations. Apply mass and energy balance related to the unit
operations. Apply process analysis to overview a production chain from raw
material to consumer. Define innovation and explain different innovation models. Describe the elements of an innovation process in a food
company. Describe the major parameters that influence the quality of
food. Evaluate where in the value chain optimisation in relation to
quality can be addressed. Validate solutions to practical problems using quantitative and
qualitative methods. Identify raw material properties of importance to the final

Overall, the student acquires knowledge so they can identify
chemical and microbiological hazards in a food item and assess
where in the production chain it is relevant to intervene against
the risk for the consumer. In addition they should be able to
assess and interpret results from chemical and microbiological risk
assessment conducted in food production and use the results as
support for decision making to improve the safety of a food item.
Especially, they should be able to assess the uncertainties in the
data used for risk assessment.

After the course the participants will be able to use the concept
of risk assessment to design simple models to assess chemical and
microbiological risks in a food item and to conduct simple risk
assessments.

and microbiological risk analysis","
The course will be taught at 6 semester of Diploma in Food Analysis
and is constructed based on CDIO principles (Conceive ( Understand
) , Design , Implement ( Introduce ) and Operate ( Perform ) ) . In
this course, the students work with food safety issues and learn
how to use the various elements within the risk analysis. Based on
a combination of working in small groups, peer-supportive classroom
and industry visits, students must carry out simple risk
assessments in accordance with international guidelines. In the
three week period, students must carry out risk assessments of
simple concrete problems. These risk assessments are reported both
orally and in writing. In addition, students must be able to
identify which data that must be collected in order to assess the
risk for the consumers. The students will work with theoretical
case studies that will be based on food produced in the food
industry, such as smoked salmon and salami. Based on the knowledge
of ingredients and production processes, students must perform an
assessment of food safety for consumers, as well as take an
informed decision about whether and how the product can be made
safer.

Our food contains chemicals on a large scale. Chemical substances
in food may come from different sources. Either as added
(intentional and unintentional) substances or contaminants (natural
and anthropogenic). In addition, we take supplements where there is
insufficient knowledge about the health effects. Ethical
considerations will be included, especially in relation to the use
of animals for testing of chemicals. The importance of different
routes of exposure will be illustrated. The students will work with
different types of toxicological studies. A tour of the
department's animal facility will be included where the
students will have the opportunity to see the various organs of a
rat. There will be assignments on different toxicological issues.
