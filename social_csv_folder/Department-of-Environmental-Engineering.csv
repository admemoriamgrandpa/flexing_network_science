A modular teaching approach is used, whereby each module builds on
the next in increasing complexity. The course is made up of the
following seven modules:

1. Initial systems analysis

2. Nutrient loads

3. Oxygen depletion in rivers

4. Interplay between detention basins in the urban drainage system
and the wastewater treatment plant's secondary clarifier

5. Stormwater infiltration and overflow treatment

6. Rule based real-time control of urban drainage-wastewater
treatment systems

7. Competetive optimisation

The key element that links the modules is an integrated software
modelling tool that illustrates the system dynamics through
exercises. Exercises are based on a case study that is used in all
modules. In the final module the student is cast in the role of a
consultant vying for a contract to minimise the pollution impact at
the least cost. Fellow students are the competing consultants.

All registered students will have access to the computer simulation
programme, model description and user manual, and exercises and
textbook explanations.

Bioresources are natural organic materials (i.e. materials derived
from living things) which may be used in society for multiple
purposes: to produce feed for animals, food for humans, feedstock
(e.g. timber, pulp, biomaterials) as well as energy. Supply and
management of these bioresources is associated with significant
environmental impacts. These are primarily related to the demand
for arable land and forest products which cause pressure on the
natural environment, ultimately incurring losses of natural biomes
such as natural forest. Additional impacts derive from the
management of these bioresources in society, for example in
relation to processing, transport, and handling of the biomass
residuals. With focus on the environment, the course provides an
overview of bioresource characteristics and potential uses,
highlighting potential competition and the connection with land-use
change impacts. Further, the course applies accounting of
greenhouse gases (GHG) as a tool to assess the climate impacts from
the entire bioresource life-cycle. 
","Understand and explain key definitions and terminology in
relation to bioresources Understand and explain how bioresources are generated in nature
(stocks, growth, C, N flows) Understand ecosystem services and key types of indicators in
relation to bioresources (e.g. biodiversity) Apply knowledge of the main characteristics of bioresources
(e.g. availability, composition, uses, typical flows in society) to
the management and utilization of bioresources Identify critical environmental consequences in the
exploitation of bioresources Quantify and analyze environmental implications related to
land-use changes, particularly carbon emissions Analyze climate impacts from selected bioresource pathways by
applying GHG accounting, including land-use change impacts Apply the above concepts and methods for solving problems on
technological systems","
Bioresources are a basis for production of feed, food, energy, and
materials in society. However, the supply and management of
bioresources can result in significant environmental impacts,
primarily because of the demand for arable land and forest products
leads to enormous pressures on the natural environment. The course
provides students with an essential understanding of the role of
bioresources in society, the most important environmental aspects
related to these, and how bioresources can be addressed from an
engineering perspective. With focus on environmental aspects, the
course addresses all key phases in the ""life cycle"" of
bioresources: production/harvest, characteristics, uses, flows in
society, and handling of residuals. The course also addresses
land-use changes and associated impacts induced by the demand for
biomasses. An overview of bioresource definitions, availability,
competing uses (e.g. competition between food and energy crops) is
provided. GHG accounting is introduced as a tool to assess the
climate impacts throughout the bioresource life-cycle.

engineering calculations and system analysis, and is widely used in
material and resource management. MFA and SFA (i.e. substance flow
analysis) are key components in sustainability assessment, as the
quantification of material and substance flows in society and
production systems are the basis for estimating the environmental
emissions and impacts associated to these flows, as well as for
developing accurate techno-economic evaluation of emerging and/or

General course objectives:

The objective of the course is to be able to describe hydrological
processes by means of relatively simple models such as purely
statistical and combined statistical and deterministic models and
then apply them to problems typical in applied hydrology. There are
large uncertainties and high natural variability in both urban and
catchment hydrological applications such as flooding and hydrologic
design. Often lumped models are needed, because the actual
processes are either not sufficiently well understood or we lack
the data to describe the processes. Therefore we need a range of
tools to quantify uncertainty and variation. Hydrological
processes, statistical testing procedures, and basic data analysis
and management by using Matlab are assumed known. Hence the major
novelty lies in combining these skills and working with actual
data. 
","Manage and analyze hydrological data by means of professional
software Apply simple data verification and validation steps in
hydrological data Apply statistical methods to model hydrological processes for
different time scales Decompose a hydrological time series into deterministic and
stochastic elements Identify rainfall-runoff components in a hydrological series
and construct and validate simple rainfall runoff models for these
components Combine sub-models into one hydrological model and apply time
series analysis methods to assess the overall model

Main objectives of the course are to establish a professional
framework for PhD students,companies and universities where the PhD
students can develop shared professional outlooks and discuss
future research initiatives. The course will act as an ”incubator”
for specialists within the urban water technology field and a
vehicle for strengthening the R&D co‐operation between
companies and university partners. In this way the course will
provide the PhD students with a broader perspective on the
individual projects and give inspiration for the future carrier. 
","Identify the urban water sector and main actors in this
field. Communicate research results to other types of professionals
within the water sector. Presentation technique. Make a scientific oral presentation of obtained results. Prepare a scientific abstract. Give constructive feed back to peers. Conduct a peer review of scientific papers. Construct a strong professional Network.","
The course is a portfolio course, i.e. each PhD student composes an
individually course plan based on pre‐identified activities, e.g.

Prepare an abstract

Make an oral presentation of the conducted research

Act as prepared opponent on selected presentations

Gets feedback from all the university supervisors an industry
representatives

acting as external supervisors

Get feedback on the oral presentation from the main supervisor
based on a

video recording of the presentation

Are exposed to a wide range of research activities in the Urban
Water field

Get presentations from externally invited Experts

Communicate in English

Technical excursions to selected industries or exhibitions

Seminars given by external, international Experts

Scientific article discussion Clubs

Prepare a critical review of scientific papers

Get inspiration to construction of tables and figures to present
results

Learn by discussing the papers how to present, discuss, evaluate
and conclude

from the data and evidence

12925 , Principles of Programming and implementation (PoPI),English , 5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,Fall,Ph.D.,Department of Environmental Engineering,"
See 12915 Principles of Programming. This course extends 12915 by
adding the study of version control systems, introducing the use of
the High Performace Computing (HPC) infrastructure at DTU, and
requiring the student to implement a major programming project.

The version control system is git, which the students need to use
to submit their major project. The introduction to the HPC is
provided by the people who maintain it from DTU Compute.

The major project can be anything that the student wishes, but must
be approved by a course lecturer so that it satisfies the points
for the course. It is suggested that the student build something
that will directly assist them in their Ph.D research.

Guidance is provided to students for their major programming
assignment. This can from architectural design, to solving small
challenges. 
","to have understood some core principles of programming,
particularly 'Laziness is a Virtue' to have gained a 'bird's eye' view of the process
of programming to understand what 'from the outside in' means as a
programming practice to understand what encapsulation is, and the value that it
offers to understand the difference between function programming and
object oriented design to be confident in producing small python and/or bash scripts,
including package encapsulation to be able to understand resource trade offs: speed vs minimal
resource usage to have a fundamental understanding of exactly what happens
when you enter a single command in bash on GNU/Linux understand the value of version control systems and to have
obtained basic proficiency in the git version control system understand how to use gitlab and/or github as a git hosting
platform understand how to submit a job to the HPC, and to be able to
use basic features of bash for job control be confident in building software tools to assist them in their
research","
