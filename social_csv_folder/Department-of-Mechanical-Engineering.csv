To obtain an understanding of the connection between the function
of structures, their geometrical shape and the choice of material,
including manufacturing considerations. The course treats basics of
mechanics and the participants will learn to analyze stiffness and
strength of simple structures and their sub-components - including
the influence of material properties. Exercises include the
formulation of simple idealized mathematical/physical models.
Furthermore, the participants will obtain knowledge of the
composition and properties of materials and will be able to select
materials for simple structures.

materials properties and materials fabrication processes","
Using a specific product as an illustrative example, e.g. a
bicycle, an understanding of the structural and functional
properties related to the product and its sub-components will be
obtained. The following material groups will be treated: metals;
ceramics; polymers; and composites. The physical concepts of
friction, forces and moments, stresses, deformations and strains,
uniaxial linear elasticity, plastic deformation and kinetic and
potential energy will be introduced. These concepts will be related
to the geometry and loading of structural components and also to
material composition, i.e. chemical structure, atomic bonding,
crystal and phase structures as well as microstructures for
composites and porous materials. The interplay between structural
properties under load, material parameters and geometry is
illustrated by simple examples of uniaxial tension/compression,
bending, torsion and buckling.

Organization: Basic statics is learned through case studies of
which an important part is the formulation of simple
physical/mathematical models for a given structure. Software like
Cambridge Engineering Selector is used for interactive material
selection. The knowledge obtained during the course is used during
two poster projects, where the design of a structure is analyzed
for statics and material choice - both from a mechanical as well as
from functional criteria.

The course is structured into 3 sections: Project work and 2
theoretical sections in product manufacturing and problem solving
(each amount to 2,5 points of the total 15 points). The project is
based on an existing product, i.e. an artefact in its context. The
artefact as well as the context are taken apart / dissected and
analysed with respect to properties, problems, visions and design
intentions that appears to be in the product. From the result of
the analysis one or more improvement aspects are identified, e.g.
concerning usability or security. The product is then redesigned
based on a ""what now if""-approach. In the project work it
is important to achieve an understanding of how requirements are
met, the nature of the product and how the product is materialized.

In the theoretical section concerning manufacturing processes there
is an overall introduction to different manufacturing flows and the
participants work with manufacturing analysis of selected products.
The course covers cutting and sheet metal processes, net-shape
processes, assembly processes, surface technology, microproduction
and polymer processes.

In the theoretical section concerning creative problem solving a
number of themes are combined. Each theme includes practical
methods, introduction to practice, and explanation of the basis for
recognition. The themes encompass goal specification, creative and
systematic search for solutions, evaluation, selection and project
planning. The theoretical parts of the course are implemented as
lectures, methododical exercises and workshop training and are
evaluated through the deliverables from the project section.

The course introduces the student to two essential areas for
design, namely environmental thinking and product life design.
Environmental problems are introduced to the students from both a
historical and a future oriented perspective and the student is
supplied with techniques for the mapping and design of product life
cycles.

The course is theoretically based and has the aim that the student
both understands and has a critical opinion of the taught theory,
and furthermore makes an effort to supplement the theoretical basis
material with additional sources.

Three tasks guide the students through the teaching syllabus and
ensure that the students demonstrate their abilities to both
understand and to further communicate the material.

- The first task is a multiple-choice examination, which tests the
students' knowledge and understanding of the course syllabus.

- The second task requires the students to write a scientific
paper, where the students are supplied with a template and the game
rules for a typical conference paper, of 8 pages. Subjects for the
paper are chosen from a list of suggestions from the teaching group
and shall form the basis for the discussions in the paper, by use
of the course’s own and other external references. The students may
write the paper alone or in groups of two.

- The third task is based around an evaluation of the papers. Each
student receives one of his/her colleague’s papers, which shall be
evaluated in the same manner as a normal conference article. The
students are evaluated according to their ability to submerge
themselves in someone else’s material, to evaluate the
environmental contents and to give a critical evaluation of the
material. This task is carried out as a single-man task.

Starting from the basic conservation laws for a fluid flow (the
Navier-Stokes equations) we derive the potential flow approximation
for the hydrodynamic interaction between a fixed or floating marine
structure and ocean waves. This problem is linearized, assuming
small amplitude waves and small body motions, to express the
structure as a linear harmonic oscillator. The relationship between
the time- and frequency-domain expressions is stressed. Green's
theorem is used to derive a number of useful relations between
coefficients, as well as high- and low-frequency limits.
Green's theorem also leads to the Boundary Integral form of the
problem and further to the Boundary Element Method (BEM) which is
the most widely used numerical solution technique for obtaining the
hydrodynamic coefficients. A number of variants of the BEM are
discussed including both 2D strip-type methods and 3D methods based

finite difference and finite-volume methods. The discontinuous
Galerkin finite element method is also introduced, but not put to

truncation error, convergence, and consistency are discussed; along
with direct and iterative solution of linear systems of equations.

some simple two-dimensional flows including: Pipe-flow; particle
motion in a potential flow around a cylinder; and laminar lid and
buoyancy driven flows in a square cylinder. Tips are given for
effective visualisation of the results using Matlab, and comparison

The relevant stages of a modeling project are discussed and
completed, starting with the definition of the task, knowledge
gathering and qualitative description of the task. This is
continued by the derivation of the mathematical equations and the
choices of method/tool for solving these. Finally, a graphical user
interface for simulation model that reflects the actual simulation
purposes is developed.

level, and with models for design and off-design operation of
plants. The modeling and simulation program Engineering Equation

Robust Design is a paradigm that aims to improve the quality and
reliability of a design. Products are exerted to geometrical
variation stemming from production tolerances, temperature changes,
load conditions, etc. If design is robust, it means that the
variance will not have a large impact on functionality or the
quality of the product. However, if the design is not robust
(sensitive) it could lead to the product not functioning, the
product not being able to be assembled, high rejection rates during
production, reduced quality for the user, product failures and in
some cases product recalls and even fatalities. The typical
strategy to deal with variance has been to tighten production
tolerances to reduce variance, however this comes at great cost in
terms of time, money and resources. By using the robust design
methodology you will learn how to reduce the sensitivity of your
designs and to not pass on difficult and costly tolerances and
process requirements to the production team. 
","Describe the effects of design sensitivity and its relationship
to variance and reliability. Analyse the clarity of the part’s interfaces in terms of its
intended and actual mobility and express this using the Coupling
Degree-metric. Design kinematically correct products and mechanisms Identify and redesign over constrained interfaces using the
Kutzbach Criterion. Apply Kinematic Design principles to reduce the complexity and
sensitivity of a design. Apply Tolerance Design to improve producability and reduce
sensitivity of a design. Identify functional requirements in a design and calculate
basic transfer functions. Calculate the 'sensitivity values' for correctly
constrained designs. Predict defect rates Apply Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T) to
describe and document geometry. Generate leading key performance indicators (KPIs) and make
tradeoffs based on design sensitivity.","

For each project theories and methods of Effectuation, Lean and
Agile, will be learned, utilised and applied by the teams. The
teams will learn in a mixed disciplinary setting, each team
comprising of a mix of competencies put together to suit the
development of the specific technology.

Each project is based on an advanced technology. The goal of the
project is to define a suitable market for the technology and
develop prototypes to demonstrate feasibility and a minimum viable
product (MVP) suitable for penetrating the market.

Each project and technology will be very different and the goals of
each team must be scoped accordingly. While the eventual goal for
all teams is to launch a product/service leading to a
sustainable-growth business; the goal of the course is to utilise
the theory and methods taught during the course in order to define
the product/service, prove it’s feasibility, formulate a
development strategy and spin-out company capable of eventually
realising it. This will require producing evidence to convince a
key stakeholder, which may be:

A customer/end-user to purchase/pre-order the product

A key partner to help develop and produce the product

A venture capitalist or fund to invest in the development of the
business

To structure this development, each week, lectures (along with
small assignments) will detail methods for exploring each block of
the business model canvas. In addition, several lectures will be
dedicated to prototyping in mechanical, electrical and software
domains. Two mid-term pitches will ensure that progress is
communicated to the teaching staff and to the other development
teams. The structure of the course dedicates the Tuesday morning to
the theoretical and methodological work, while the Friday sessions
focus on the project work.

concept of manufacturing process chain is central in the course.
Seldom a single manufacturing process is sufficient for the
realization of a micro component and different processes must be
combined together in a coherent way to realize the product. Such
processes are the expression of different technical areas and as
such multidisciplinarity within micro manufacturing is emphasized.

structures involving acoustic interaction Construct complex finite element models for solving
acoustic-mechanical interaction problems at micro scale.","
The course focuses on theoretical lectures combined with computer
exercises using Comsol/Matlab to solve structural vibration
problems with and without acoustic coupling. Solution methods will
cover modal superposition and direct methods. Various model
reduction techniques will be covered as well. Different material
and damping models will be analyzed and absorbing boundary
conditions will be implemented for the simulation of wave
propagation. Power flow analysis and evaluation of kinetic,
potential and dissipated energy in vibrating structures will be
carried out. Interaction problems are formulated and computations
in the form of eigenvalues and forced vibrations are performed.
Complex finite element models for micro scale components are
constructed.

Lectures and computer exercises serve basis for two reports to be
handed in during and in the end of the 13-week period.
