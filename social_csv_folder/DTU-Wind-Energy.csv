Based on the production of a selected component, a review is given
of materials and methods of manufacture of advanced fiber
composites with polymer matrix combined with a review of methods of
control of material quality. Focus will be on manufacturing and
control of advanced fiber composites, i.e. fiber composites with
high content of long direction-oriented fibers. Matrix materials
will be thermosetting for manufacturing by vacuum infusion or
autoclave consolidation of a prepreg material. Composites based on
thermoplastic matrix materials can be manufactured by press
consolidation. 
","Structure and plan experimental work within the group of
students Set out the available materials for fiber-reinforced composites
and their properties, advantages and disadvantages Select and customize an appropriate manufacturing method for a
specific fiber composite component Take into account the potential conflict between the desired
fiber orientations and fiber content from a structural perspective,
in relation to possible fiber orientations and fiber content from a
manufacturing-technological viewpoint Select the process parameters that will lead to the production
of fiber composites with good material quality Calculate the weight of fiber and matrix and compare with
measured values and volume-related content Explain the advantages and disadvantages of manufacturing
composites by press consolidation, autoclave consolidation or
vacuum infusion Develop a plan for control of material quality of fiber
composite components","
There will be preliminary experiments to demonstrate relevant
manufacturing methods used for assessment and choice of method and
process parameters for the given component. The group should set up
a plan for the experimental work and realization of the subject
within the frame of the course. An introduction to basic design
criteria for fiber composites will be given. Calculation of the
stiffness of the composite will be compared with the specific
stiffness of the test subjects to assess the plan for the
manufacture of composite items. Thus, students will be able to
explain the necessary quantity of material and plan a manufacturing
process based on relevant process parameters.

The course begins with lectures and exercises introducing the basic
concepts. Students are also introduced to the requirements for the
final project and are given access to student projects from
previous years. After several lectures, the students will begin
working on a project assignment, individually or in groups of 2.
The topic of the assignment is defined in a discussion between the
student and the teacher so it reflects the student's interests
and helps solve an actual engineering challenge. The project topics
are then presented in front of fellow course participants. For the
remainder of the course, the students will in parallel attend
lectures and work on their projects. At the end of the course, the
students will make a presentation of the results of their project,
and submit a report containing their assignments as well as a
solution to the three chosen in-class exercises.

Through participation in a research project for a shorter period of
time, the student will try to answer a question or solve a problem,
which is connected to the work of the supervising PhD student. The
student will gain forefront knowledge within an area of wind
energy, while gaining insight into how the scientific method is put
into practice to solve topical issues for society. The student will
also gain general competencies, e.g. the ability to participate in
a constructive mentor-mentee relationships and the ability to
communicate science – in writing as well as orally

Participation in a research project in close collaboration with a

points of the scientific issue must be communicated orally to the
other participants of the course. The project results and method
must be communicated in a final, written report.

46900 , Ph.D. Course in Wind Turbine Dynamics and Aeroelasticity,English , 2.5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,Outside schedule structure,Ph.D.,DTU Wind Energy,"
This course is aimed at graduate students interested in wind energy
research and at engineers in the wind turbine industry with the
purpose to learn how to describe, analyze and optimize the modal
dynamics and aeroelastic stability of wind turbines. The
participants must have pre-knowledge of vibration analysis and
linear dynamics of mechanical systems. No particular knowledge of
wind turbines is needed; however, a general knowledge of structural
dynamics and/or aerodynamics is required. 
","List and describe the mode shapes of a horizontal-axis wind
turbine at standstill and in operation Explain the methods of computing the modal frequencies, damping
and shapes of the structural and aeroelastic modes of operating
wind turbines Apply these methods for modal analysis of wind turbines with
and without the effect of aerodynamic forces Analyze and optimize modal dynamics of three-bladed wind
turbines, and to identify these structural modes in the aeroelastic
response of operating wind turbines Explain the mechanisms of the aeroelastic instabilities called
stall-induced vibrations and classical flutter Analyze the risk of these instabilities for a given wind
turbine Present and disseminate the important issues of wind turbine
modal dynamics and aeroelastic stability to colleagues and fellow
students Perform further state-of-the-art research within dynamics and
aeroelastic stability of wind turbines","
Modal frequencies, damping and shapes of the vibration modes of
operating wind turbines can be computed with and without the
influence of the aerodynamic forces from the surrounding flow. The
vibration modes of the unforced turbine (excluding the aerodynamic
forces) constitute a dynamic fingerprint that defines its modal
dynamics. These structural modes form the basis of the aeroelastic
response of wind turbines due to the aerodynamic forces. The
vibration modes of the turbine including the aerodynamic forces
determine its aeroelastic stability properties through the damping
of these aeroelastic modes. Stall-induced vibrations and classical
flutter are the two main mechanisms that may lead to aeroelastic
instabilities of wind turbines with negative damping of an
aeroelastic mode.
