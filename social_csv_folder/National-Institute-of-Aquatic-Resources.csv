biological processes control the species interactions and their
responses to environmental forcing, and how global patterns emerge
from these individual interactions. The course offers a mechanistic
understanding of the most important biological processes in aquatic
systems and their dependency on the environment. We will illustrate
different scales of the marine environment, starting at the
individual level, and advancing to population, community and global
scales of the marine ecosystem. The course will enable the students

more or less vulnerable to human activities such as fishing and
eutrophication. The course lectures will initially cover key
concepts and paradigms in fisheries oceanography and then be
followed by lectures on larval feeding ecology and predation
processes (e.g., fish, jellyfish) before progressing to the

Fisheries management has globally failed because the combined
ecological, economical and sociological interactions and
consequences of the fishery and the management are not considered.
The scientific management advice is at present based on evaluation
of single stocks. For example are the overall biological and
economic consequences of mixed fisheries ignored, where several
stocks of both target and un-intended by-catch species are
exploited in the same fishery. The effects of technological
development and economic incentives as well behavioral changes in
the fishery are not taken into consideration, which impact the
development of both stocks, fisheries and the ecosystem. Also, the
ecological interactions are not integrated into advice. Newly
developed fisheries and ecosystem based marine management models,
which include bio-economic management evaluation tools, cover this
complexity. This enables a more flexible and integrated scientific
evaluation and advice with respect to development in stocks and
fisheries also considering impacts from environmental/climatic,
fisheries, and management start conditions under different
management systems.

The course aims at making the student familiar with selected

global understanding of the complexity in fisheries management
systems. There will be introduced methods to describe structure and
calculate fisheries efficiency among fishing fleets, and there will

student with basic quantitative and qualitative tools to estimate
and evaluate fisheries impact on stocks and the marine ecosystem
under different pre-conditions by use of the models and the
different calculation and evaluation methods. In general, the
course will give the student tools to evaluate ecological and

management, i.e. management options, strategies and management
systems, before implementation under consideration of other
ecosystem impacts. This also includes a qualitative evaluation and
understanding of sociological and economic consequences for
different stakeholders and actors. Furthermore, the course provides
methods to evaluate and discuss ecosystem based management and

The aim of the course is to provide students with theoretical and
practical knowledge about how modern DNA based methods can be used
in management of fisheries resources and biodiversity conservation
in aquatic environments. Through seminars and laboratory exercises
students will learn how genetic methods are used to identify fish
species and to partition fish into genetically separated
populations (stocks), and how this knowledge can be applied as a
tool in fisheries management, such as for defining management units
and for enforcement of fisheries regulations. Students are expected
to understand and analyse how human activities such as fishing,
habitat alteration and climate change can affect biodiversity in
aquatic ecosystems and how genetic composition and human
evolutionary impact affect the survival and productivity of fish
populations. Finally, the students are expected to be able to
analyse the consequences of different management strategies on the
genetic diversity on all levels of biological organisation from
individual over population to species and be able to predict
consequences of individual management strategies for survival and
productivity of wild fish populations in marine and freshwater
environments.

such as the population concept, migration, genetically effective
population size, selection and local adaptation. Demonstrate knowledge of central concepts in conservation
biology such as minimum effective population sizes, optimal design
of reserves and protected areas. Analyse population genetic data using statistical methods of
relevance to fisheries science, fisheries management and
conservation biology. Demonstrate insights into the newest developments within
genomic research and evaluate how these methods can be applied for
analysis of genetic adaptations to the local environment, so-called
local adaptations, and environmentally induced stress. Analyse the consequences of habitat alterations, exploitation
and climate change on the genetic composition and evolution of fish

The course is based on a number of cases and practical laboratory
exercises, illustrating how DNA based methods are applied in
analysis of fish populations and for generating information of
importance for defining management areas, estimation of population
size, identification of Illegal, Uncontrolled and Unreported
fishing, conservation of genetic resources, as well as “genetic
monitoring” of the impact of human activities such as fishing,
supplementation and global change. The course will review basic
concepts in relation to how genetic variation is distributed within
and among populations, “population genetic” parameters, such as
mutation, migration, random genetic drift and selection. This
includes a discussion of the population concept, effective
population size, neutral genes and genes subject to selection, as
well as adaptation to local environment. The subjects will be
integrated with central general concepts in conservation biology,
such as minimum effective population size for avoiding inbreeding
and loss of genetic variation, as well as design of protected areas
for conservation of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential.
Recent developments in genetic and genomic research will be

opportunities in fisheries genetics, for example by identifying
genes of important ecological function and fish species from
environmental samples (e-DNA) and processed fish products. The
different topics will be integrated through evaluation of how human
induced environmental alterations like climate change and fisheries
induced evolution are expected to affect future adaptation,
distribution and abundance of fish populations. Effects of
different management and conservation tools, i.e. marine protected
areas, supplementation and fisheries regulations, will be evaluated
in relation to mitigating potential negative genetic effects.

Recreational fishing is a billion euro business which directly and
indirectly impacts 1) the ecology of aquatic ecosystems, e.g.
through effects on the environment, food webs or on specific
populations, as well as 2) the human dimension in terms of social
and economic processes and consequences. Moreover, when managing
recreational fisheries it seems just as important to understand
angler behavior as it is to understand how and why the fish behave.
Therefore the interdisciplinary interaction between social and
natural science holds the future for successful recreational
fisheries management. The course will introduce adaptive management
and the three tools in traditional recreational fishery management;
fish stocking, habitat restoration and fishery regulation, with
special focus on the latter (e.g. catch and release fishing, bag
limits, closed seasons etc.) In addition, human dimensions, such as
angler behavior and demography, ethical costs and socio-economic
benefits to the community from angling will be addressed. Finally,
a part of the course will be dedicated to introducing methodologies
used when studying population dynamics and behavior in fish, and
when investigating the human dimensions in recreational fishing.

The first week of the course will take place at DTU Aqua,
Department of Freshwater Fisheries and Ecology in Silkeborg. Here
the students will get hands-on experience with different methods
used when investigating recreational fisheries. In addition focus
will be on different management disciplines. The last two weeks of

selective properties of a gear. -","
This is a 5 days intensive summer course based in Hirtshals
(Denmark) in close proximity to the fishing industry and the
facilities of the North Sea science park.

The main fish capturing methods will be described together with the
underlying technological and biological principles. The effects
caused by the fish capturing process on the stocks and on the
environment will be described and discussed in relation to present
and future management strategies for effective and sustainable
fisheries. Principles for design, innovation and development of
fishing gears and methods will be explained and demonstrated during
lectures and excursions to net companies, commercial fishing
vessels and the Hirtshals flume tank.

Computer exercises will be used to demonstrate methods that make
inference about the selective properties of fishing gears. The
student will learn to formulate and implement computer models for
size selection processes in fishing gears.

A practical training exercise will be conducted where experimental
methodologies and relevant technology will be tried.

The diversity of life is key to the provision of key ecosystem
goods and services which are used by society and for maintaining
the foodwebs which provide and support these goods and services.
However this diversity is increasingly challenged and threatened by
continuing socio-economic activities and development, including
direct exploitation, eutrophication, climate change, and the
introduction of non-native species. Presently, our knowledge of how
biodiversity is impacted by such perturbations is limited and often
not reliable enough to provide strong guidance for marine policy
makers, resource managers and spatial planners. Both new
understanding of biodiversity and new approaches for quantifying
its variations are needed to help apply biodiversity knowledge in
policies that can support long-term sustainable use of ecosystems
and their goods and services. 
","Learn ways to model variations in biodiversity due to both
natural and anthropogenic drivers. Demonstrate how variations in biodiversity affect species
interactions in foodwebs and the provision of ecosystem services
and products. Quantify how such natural and man-made perturbations affect
both taxonomic and func-tional descriptors of biodiversity for
major taxonomic groups in the Baltic Sea (e. g., fish, benthos,
plankton). Learn the key Baltic and European biodiversity policy and
governance frameworks, and how supporting data can be collected and
applied. Learn sources of data for analyzing variations in biodiversity
in the Baltic Sea. Develop quantitative analytical, modelling and programming
skills (e. g., R, excel, Python, Matlab). - -","
This course will use the Baltic Sea as a case study system to learn
how biodiversity affects the func-tioning of ecosystems and
foodwebs, and how they provide goods and services to society. The
Baltic Sea has relatively few marine species compared to other
marine areas due especially to its low salinity. Yet it provides
many of the same services and goods as other systems. Why is this
possible? Will this situation continue in the future and is the
Baltic Sea more vulnerable to human impacts than other systems?
This course will provide new biodiversity understanding and
quantitative tools that can help students address such questions.
The course will have an emphasis on quantitative and functional
approaches to biodiversity. The course will be taught by several
leading experts on Baltic biodiversity.

To enhance students skills in communicating their research results
effectively to the scientific community and the public through oral
and written communication. The course also involves organisation of
scientific seminars / workshops, networking and other communication
issues important for a research career. The course is open to
students from all areas of aquatic science, irrespective of
university and research field. Sustainable use and management of
aquatic resources require a combination of knowledge from a
multitude of scientific disciplines. As such the course promotes
interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and opportunities for
networking across discipline boundaries. 
","Present their oral and written work for a diverse audience
(press, public and science fora) Organise and conduct scientific seminars and workshop. Overview and relate their work to different disciplines within
aquatic science and technology. Apply an appreciative approach to inquiry and constructive
feedback in the debate of scientific issues. Use the advantages of an established network; e.g., to develop
co-operation with fellow Ph.D students / scientists. - - -","
The course consists of two annual events: a 2-days seminar in
August with students presenting their PhD research (talks and
posters), and a 2-days workshop in January offering formalised
training in presentation skills. Scientific seminars focus on
presenting and debating scientific work using ‘appreciative
inquiry’ and ‘constructive feedback’ from an audience including
fellow students and supervisors. The focus is on enhancing both
performance and scientific insights. The seminars include both oral
presentations and poster sessions. The program of the January
workshops changes on a bi-annual schedule. Alternating workshops
address oral presentation and scientific writing. The oral
workshops focus on presentation of scientific results and means to
enhance personal performance, while the written workshops focus on
publication of research in scientific journals, popular science and
interacting with the press. The workshops use theory, practise and
application, and typically include invited speakers and
consultants. As part of the course, students will be tasked to
organise one seminar / workshop as part of a planning group. Tasks
include announcing a call, registration and logistics, planning of
a scientific program, hosting and reporting the event. A group
report on the organisation and contents of the scientific
seminar/workshop is requested.
