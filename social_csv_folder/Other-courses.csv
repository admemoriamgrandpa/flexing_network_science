KU028 , Applied Marine and Freshwater Ecology,English , 10 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,Fall,MSc,Other courses,"
To give the students i) an introduction to marine and freshwater
ecosystems ii) an understanding of how human influence and
exploitation of the living resources affect marine and freshwater
ecosystem structure and functioning, and how these effects are
linked to the physical and chemical environment. 
","Identify the main groups of organisms in aquatic ecosystems
(bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophytes, benthic
organisms and fish) and their trophic interactions Identify central marine and freshwater habitats and describe
their characteristics Describe the role of marine microorganisms in local and global
biochemical cycling. Describe the effects of climate change on marine and freshwater
systems, exemplified by selected groups of organisms. Determine major anthropogenic influences on aquatic organisms
in offshore, coastal, estuarine and freshwater habitats. Determine the resource requirements (bottom-up) and trophic
interactions (top-down) for aquatic organisms and discuss this in
relation to their cultivation. Evaluate the potential for sustainable exploitation of marine
resources (e.g. micro-algae) Describe the effects of increased nutrient input to aquatic
systems, with particular emphasis on freshwater lakes and coastal
ecosystems. List and explain different methods to restore nutrient enriched
lakes and low quality habitats in running water and explain their
strengths and weaknesses.","
Sustainable utilization of marine and freshwater ecosystems and the
development of new aquatic production systems are of vital
importance for the food supply and environment of future
generations. In order to secure sustainability a thorough
understanding of the ecosystems involved is needed. In this course
the students will be introduced to general ecological patterns of
aquatic ecosystems. This introduction will be based on case studies
representing specific applied issues primarily within marine
ecosystems. In addition each case study will provide the frame for
understanding and assessing the potentials, limitations and
environmental effects of human activities for marine and freshwater
ecosystem structure and function. The cases will be presented in a
scientific context, where an understanding of the underlying basic
physiological and ecological processes will provide the foundation
for evaluating and predicting environmental effects of human
activities on aquatic systems.

By the end of the course, students shall be able to account for the
occurrence, aetiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, complications,
diagnostics, prevention and treatment of significant diseases, and
to use the medical terminology related to physiology and
pathophysiology. Furthermore, students should be able to account
for the human organism's physiology and pathophysiology and
have a fundamental understanding of commonly occurring diseases.

KU103 , Tissue and Movement Biomechanics (KU),English , 10 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,"F2 (Mon 13-17, Thurs 8-12)",MSc,Other courses,"
The objective of the course is to introduce students to original
scientific articles in the fields of gait analysis
(pathological/normal), sports biomechanics, ergonomics/work
environment, muscle and tendon mechanics, tissue biomechanics,
motor control and simulation. Students will also perform a
practical assignment addressing a specific and classical problem
associated with the biomechanics of the locomotor system. Through
reading of articles, student presentations and discussions,
students shall achieve a critical understanding of problems of
basic and applied research concerning the biomechanics of the
locomotor system. There will be special focus on the anatomy of the
hip joint and the low back, which will be modeled by the use of
finite elements (FE). Furthermore, the objective is that students
acquire a thorough overview of existing knowledge and methods of
modern biomechanical research so that they may themselves initiate
independent scientific projects at master thesis level.

KU105 , Advanced physiological modelling,English , 10 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,F5 (Wed 8-17),MSc,Other courses,"
The course aims to provide overview of current research topics in
mathematical physiology by synthesizing a coherent description of
the physiological background with realistic mathematical models and
their analysis. The program will give students the opportunity to
develop mathematical and computer modeling skills, whilst at the
same time will introduce students to cutting-edge experimental and
computational techniques. A wide variety of topics are touched
upon, from biochemistry and cellular signaling to neural activity
and vascular networks.
