highlight the aim of the suggested project and should describe how
they approach, delimit and plan each project phase. It is highly
encouraged, but not required, that the students will continue
working on the selected project throughout all modules of the
integrated project. Students from other MSc lines that are
interested in following the course should be aware of that they
