The technology to fabricate mesoscopic and nanoscopic devices is
progressing rapidly. These systems possess, apart from forming the
basis for future electronic components, many fascinating physical
properties and research in this field is a central topic in modern
condensed matter physics. The theoretical description requires
advanced techniques based on many-body theory (e.g., Green
functions and diagrammatic perturbation theory). The general goal
of this course is to give the student some general acquaintance
with these techniques, and an overview of the basic physics. This
course also gives sufficient background knowledge for further
studies of many-body physics, including a short resume of complex
analysis (residue calculus).

This is an application oriented course on electron structure theory
of molecules and condensed matter, where you both will write
software in the programming language Mathematica, and possibly use
a commercial software packet for electron transport.

During the first two weeks you will be introduced to the
theoretical methods enabling you to calculate electronic transport
using Green's functions. This is done by solving problems and
using Mathematica (no prior knowledge is necessary). In the third
week you will get the opportunity to study a problem of your own
choice. A report with results from the calculations shall be
written during the course.

The topics are chosen so as to match active research at DTU
Nanotech and Center for Nanostructured Graphene (CNG). These will
therefore change from year to year. Typical topics include:
Electronic structure of graphene nanostuctures, nanotubes,
hydrocarbons, and polymers. Calculations of currents through
molecular electronics devices and graphene nanostructures.

encapsulation and rejection of implanted materials. Immunological
reactions associated with implanted materials and strategies to
avoid or modulate these reactions will also be discussed. The
experimental exercises will focus on the evaluation of surface
modified materials (chemical and biochemical modifications) with
respect to their cytotoxicity (cell toxicity) and the ability of
cells to adhere to the surfaces. The exercises will show how simple
modifications of the surface can result in major changes in the
surface's ability to promote or reduce cell adhesion.

Drug delivery is a diverse area, but often nano and micro
technologies are necessary for developing a drug delivery system.
It can be complicated to develop and understand these systems, and
also to choose the optimal system. In this course we will get
introductions to various technologies from academic and industrial
perspectives, and also try various techniques out in the
laboratories. There will also be a focus on label-free sensors in
drug delivery – a field with a large potential. This course and the
sensor-based summer school will run in parallel with some lectures
and group work together.

We will combine lectures on sensing principles in drug delivery and
on nano and micro technologies in drug delivery with hands-on
laboratory work. You will have the possibility to: 1) develop
technologies for oral drug delivery, 2) test the application of the
technology in relevant analytical methods.

The experiments will be based on commercially available instruments
as well as on systems developed at DTU Nanotech.

The experimental work will be performed in teams and the developed
technologies with be discussed in plenum to be able to discover pro
and cons on the various technologies and techniques. By the end of
the summer school we will in collaboration have generated an
overview of technologies in drug delivery in terms of sensors and
pharmaceutical technologies. To pass the course, you must take
active part in the group work and in the scientific discussions.

The course covers the possibilities of using micro- and
nanotechnology in the field of diagnostics and pharmaceutical
development. The starting point will be technology in actual use in
devices, for example, for point of care diagnostics, high
throughput screening, advanced in vitro cell culture models for
testing drugs and new way to deliver drugs (nano particles will not
be covered).

The interplay between biological components and micro- and
nanoscale components of such systems will be examined. Furthermore,
device fabrication technologies, detection principles and operating
aspects of micro- and nano-devices will be explored in the course.
The course will also enable the students to understand how emerging
micro- and nanotechnologies can solve bottlenecks in e.g. high
throughput screening, cell culture and diagnostic. The impact of
micro- and nanotechnology on pharmaceutical industry will be
discussed. 
","Describe the main features of point of care (POC) diagnostics,
including microfluidics and detection methods (optical,
electrochemical and mechanical) Explain micro- and nanotechnology assisted methods used in drug
screening, drug testing and drug delivery Analyse advantages and disadvantages of common practice i
diagnostics and medicine Analyse working principle and realisation of micro- and
nanotechnological devices applied in diagnostics, high throughput
analysis systems including drug screening, and medicine Compare the devices and methods to the ones traditionally
employed in the pharmaceutical industry and evaluate their
potential to improve common practice Produce and present a poster fitting a professional scientific
conference Synthesise cross disciplinary information Find and evaluate material that is relevant for a given
problem Present scientific material in a report","
Existing point of care (POC) devices will be used as examples in
the course. We will, for example, examine how glucose levels,
viruses and blood count are performed in POC devices. With these
devices as starting points, the principles of micro- and
nano-technology in these devices will be explained. This includes
basic microfluidics, detections principles and fabrication methods.
The examples give insight into POC devices and the integration of
microfluidic, enzymatic and chemical reporter systems, sensors and
data reporting/managing systems.

The next complexity level examined will be how micro- and
nanotechnology methods are implemented in new high throughput drug
screening systems. These HTS methods are depending on micro- and
nanoscale components, biochemical components, and other nano
technological tools, for example, for detection. It is a particular
focus of the course to provide knowledge how these components play
together to in the new types of ultra HTS meths. Strategies to
screen large biological and small molecules libraries are
discussed.

More advanced cell culture and cell analysis technology replacing,
for example, animals in toxicology testing will be explored. This
includes construction and operation of cell culture chips,
detection systems such as fluorescence (FRET, TIRF, TRF and
others), and electrochemical detection. Lastly, various methods and
devices for localised and time controlled release of drugs will be
discussed.

Development of advanced formulations that can deliver drugs to
diseased target tissue or for increasing drug uptake and transport
across biological barriers is becoming increasingly important for
the pharmaceutical industry. The Drug Delivery course is focused on
material aspects of how drug delivery formulations can be designed
for improving drug bioavailability and biodistribution and how
these materials interact with the biological milieu. Furthermore,
the different administration routes will be discussed in
combination with drug delivery challenges. The course participants
will also gain knowledge on the main toxicological and immunogical
responses that may be associated with drug delivery systems. 
","Explain the advantages of using drug delivery systems for
treatment of diseases Describe the main drug administration routes and the biological
barriers associated with them. The focus will in particular be on
oral, nasal, intravenous, intramuscular and dermal
administration Delineate how drug delivery strategies may impact therapeutic
index and overall safety and efficacy of drug therapies Make rational design choices of drug carrier materials for
different drug classes, e.g. small drugs, peptides, RNA and
DNA Make formulation design choices in relation to the different
administration routes Explain factors influencing drug stability in formulations Describe suitable drug release strategies for particle based

Introduction to the different concepts of drug delivery. A number
of drug delivery systems that are used in the clinic today will be
described. These systems include, liposomes for treating cancer,
adjuvant systems in vaccines, particle based anti-fungicides. There
will be particular focus on the basic principles of how to optimize
drug transport across biological barriers and how to minimize
undesired immune responses. The biophysical chemistry behind drug
delivery system design, drug encapsulation and release will be an
important part of the course. Furthermore, the different types of
particle based carrier systems and the materials they are
constituted of will be discussed in detail. Lastly, the use of
carrier systems in diagnostic applications will be discussed
