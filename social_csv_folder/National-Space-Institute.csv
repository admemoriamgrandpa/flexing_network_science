Radar and radiometer systems are used from satellites and aircrafts
to measure and monitor the surface of the Earth, including the land
surfaces, the oceans and the atmosphere. This is called remote
sensing or Earth observation and is of utmost importance for the
monitoring of the Earth’s environment and climate.

The general course objectives are to provide the students with an
understanding of those radar and radiometer techniques and systems,
that are used for remote sensing, with a special emphasize on the
technical description of the sensors, and on the application of
these techniques for measuring and monitoring of properties of the
surface of the Earth. This also includes knowledge about the
necessary data processing techniques.

The course includes a survey with application examples of sensors
like side looking radar, radar altimeter, windscatterometer,

within oceanography including sea pollution, glaciology including
sea ice, mapping, farming, and forestry. The course includes for
each of the above-mentioned sensors a description of the techniques
as well as the relevant applications with examples, and in addition
discussions about the necessary data processing and interpretation
methods.

To give an in-depth understanding of modern scientific
instrumentation for X- and Gamma-Ray Astronomy. This will include
both the telescopes and detector side.

The course will start with a short description of the field as it
has developed since its inception in the beginning of the space
age. This is followed by a theoretical introduction to X-ray
telescopes and detectors. This will include all relevant solid
state physics aspects - covering reflection and scattering from
mirrored surfaces and the various types of absorption and
interaction in solid state detectors. The course will also include
laboratory exercises on X-ray mirrors and detector prototypes.
Finally the course will contain an introduction to the analytical
and numerical methods used for the simulation of the scientific
capabilities of realistic instrument complexes as well as a
description of the requirements and methods used for on-ground
calibration.

objects, and the involved physical processes.

physics involved in accretion mechanisms describe and analyse the high energy phenomena that occur in
the center of active galaxies explain and exploit X-ray observations of clusters of
galaxies.","
This course deals with some of the most energetic objects and
phenomena in the Universe. Examples are supernovae, neutron stars,
and black holes that are accreting matter from their surroundings,
as well as gigantic clusters of galaxies. Most of what we know
about such objects comes from the study of high energy photons
arriving at Earth. The physical processes, thermal or non-thermal,
that produce these energetic photons will be explained. The basic
techniques, instrumentation, observational methods, and analysis
tools employed to exploit these photons will be touched upon.

The course gives further descriptions of the properties, their
temporal and spectral variations, of different astrophysical
sources of X-rays, such as supernova remnants, accretion mechanisms
around a neutron star or a black hole in X-ray binaries, active
galaxies harboring a supermassive black hole in their center, and
clusters of galaxies. High energy astrophysics is a very active
area of astronomy today, and due to the atmospheric absorption of
these radiations, the observations are performed with satellites.

The aim of the course is to give the students an advanced knowledge
to modern techniques of data analysis used in observational X-ray
astrophysics, as well as to teach them to estimate the quality of
the data and measurements in relation to the relevant theories.

results","
This course aims to train students to plan, acquire, and analyze
observational data obtained from various X-ray instruments on-board
astrophysics space missions.

The course will begin with introductory lectures on X-ray
astrophysics and X-ray instrumentation, followed by lectures and
exercises on the practical use of different instruments, data
analysis software, and associated tools and pipelines. The
participants will work with various software to produce scientific
results out of raw data. Observation examples will be provided from
currently flying space facilities like the NASA NuSTAR and Swift,
satellites as well as the ESA INTEGRAL and XMM satellites.

On the basis of a short project during the last week of the course,
the students will apply the acquired knowledge from the hands-on
sessions to perform scientific data analysis of high energy
astrophysical phenomena observed with the above-mentioned
satellites. The processing of actual observations will include
source detection, light-curve production, and spectral analysis, as
well as the utilization of relevant astrophysical databases and
methods.
