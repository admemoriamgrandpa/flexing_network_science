The students will obtain advanced knowledge on how eukaryotic cells
work at the molecular level providing them with a global view of
the different layers of complexity displayed by living cells, which
is necessary to understand human disease, to design disease models
and to develop improved industrial cell factories. 
","Name the fundamental cellular structures and explain their
organization. Use key features of protein transport in eukaryotic cells to
propose a strategy for protein export. Explain DNA synthesis and maintenance as well as chromosome
segregation in mitotic and meiotic cells. Use Mendelian and non-Mendelian genetics to predict patterns of
inheritance. Predict how defects in the eukaryotic cell cycle affect the
cell. Explain how defects in cellular processes may underlie human
disease. Perform simple calculations based on data derived from
biological systems. Analyze and interpret experimental results in the context of
the course curriculum. Evaluate and choose among different molecular
biology/biochemistry techniques/approaches for attaining a
specified experimental goal.","
The course focuses on molecular genetics, molecular biology and
cell biology. A wide range of molecular processes like DNA
replication, repair and recombination, transcription, translation,
post-translational modifications, protein sorting and cell cycle
control will be covered. For simplicity, these topics will
initially be described individually and for single cell organisms
like yeasts. However, during the course, complexity will gradually
increase as we will see how these processes occur in complex
multicellular eukaryotes, and how their actions are coordinated via
global regulatory networks, for example by signal transduction
pathways. In the end, this knowledge will allow us to discuss
topics like developmental biology and the molecular biology of
cancer. Two recurrent motifs will be highlighted throughout the
course: understanding the interconnectedness of physiological
processes within the cell, and devising strategies to intervene in
these complex processes, either to manipulate a
production/​model-organism or to develop a cure for a human
disease.

The laboratory course will focus on molecular biology, genetics and
physiology of yeasts and filamentous fungi. During the course we
will understand the dynamics of DNA. How often does it mutate, how
often does homologous recombination take place, how often do cells
loose a plasmid or a chromosome? Moreover, we will explore how
defects in DNA damage repair systems influence cellular fitness and
behavior to provide specific clues to the actions DNA repair
mechanisms.

We will also look into how one can analyze a physiological relevant
process by making specific alterations of the genome of an
organism. Hence, we will introduce point mutations, deletions and
GFP extensions in defined genes in the genomes of baker's yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the mold Aspergillus nidulans.

In the first part of the course we will transform microbial cells
for strain construction; and in the second part, we will
characterize the resulting mutant strains and the introduced DNA
molecules. Classical genetic methods, DNA isolation, chromosome
separation, restriction analysis, tetrad dissection and analysis,
replica plating, Southern blotting and hybridization and PCR
techniques are used to analyze the transformed strains and to
understand the mechanisms of genetic recombination operating in
living organisms.

With data generation becoming evermore easy in biology, life
scientists and engineers are increasingly facing challenges in
analyzing data in their line of work. For example, simple
bioinformatics tasks can become a huge drain on scientists’ time as
they repetitively copy and paste information into web interfaces
instead of running batch operations.

Furthermore, with genetic manipulations becoming evermore easy to
carry out, qualifications demanded of cell factory engineers will
shift away from the ability to construct strains towards analysis
of data and design of new strains, a trend that is only going to be
accelerated with DNA synthesis costs plummeting and lab automation
becoming more widely available. Therefore, it will be essential
that the next generation of PhD students in cell factory
engineering are trained in computational tools needed for data
analysis and strain design.

As a first step towards this goal, two courses (two days each) will
be held back to back:

1. A Software Carpentry course that covers basic computational
skills and specifically targets life scientists (task
automatization, command line usage, programming with Python, data
analysis with R, version control etc.). Since 1998, Software
Carpentry has been teaching basic lab skills for research computing
to scientists and engineers and course materials have continuously
been adapted and tailored to their problems and needs.

2. Taking advantage of the materials covered in (1), a
computational cell factory design course that covers basic
genome-scale metabolic modeling and in silico strain design methods
will be held for people involved in strain engineering projects or
metabolic research in general.
