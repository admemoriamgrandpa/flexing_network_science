42002 , Modelling and Analysis of Sustainable Energy Systems using Operations Research,English , 5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,E4B (Fri 8-12),MSc,DTU Management Engineering,"
The objective of this course is to introduce the students to the
fundamentals of energy system modelling. With focus on a
sustainable energy system, we consider various energy technologies;
with particular emphasis on renewable energy sources, such as wind
turbines. We aim to formulate simple models of power systems with
renewable energy sources. We aspire to analyse the operation and
design of the system in terms of sustainability, reliability and
economic efficiency. To address such challenges, an important part
of the course is devoted to theory and practice of modelling,
optimisation and simulation. The idea is that the students will
learn to carry out the whole process of identifying a problem,
formulating a model, preparing data, implementing the model and
analysing the results on their own (this will partly be achieved by
working in groups on a project which focuses on a specific design
issue at the end of the course). 
","List the technical challenges involved in reliable and
economically efficient operation and design of a sustainable energy
system. The degree of detail should be comparable to that of a
public seminar for industry Formulate a mathematical programming problem; identify
objectives, constraints, variables and parameters; characterise
feasibility, optimality and unboundedness; formulate and interpret
the dual problem, formulate an integer program Formulate economic dispatch and unit commitment of power
producing units, electricity storage operation and integration of
renewable energy in the mathematical programming framework Formulate a linear/an integer programming model for a specific
problem within energy system operation and investment, given a
qualitative description of the problem Implement a mathematical programming model in GAMS, given a
mathematical formulation of the problem Collect, prepare and format input data, e.g. time series data
for production and consumption, for the models of this course Verify the models and carry out model runs to such an extent
that the results can be used to analyse a given problem Analyse and present the model results. The level should be such
that both results and implications are readily understandable by
the other students in the course","
The course provides an overview of a sustainable energy system with
a view towards the challenges involved in operation and design
within short and long term planning, i.e. time scales of hours to
days. To address such challenges mathematical programming models
are used in energy. The basics of optimization by mathematical
programming, the application to energy system modelling, and
software implementation are introduced during the course.

42003 ," Energy Economics, Markets and Policies",English , 10 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,"E2 (Mon 13-17, Thurs 8-12)",MSc,DTU Management Engineering,"
With the point of departure in economic theory the purpose is to
provide the students with a fundamental understanding of the
current situation and the dynamic challenges that lie ahead for the
energy sector both nationally and internationally. This includes an
understanding of energy economics, energy markets, politics,
regulation and resources. The theoretical basis of the course is
the economic theories relevant for those topics. Furthermore, the
students are expected to relate these elements to the term
sustainability. The environmental policy instruments will be
compared in relation to different policy objectives and
institutional settings in the energy sector. The students are
expected to develop competences in interpreting, explaining and
discussing the challenges of the energy sector, policy and
regulation from an economic perspective. 
","Explain and apply basic concepts of economic theory such as
profit maximisation, demand and supply Describe a country’s energy structure and apply relevant
indicators to compare it with other countries Identify the interaction between limited resources and
continuous economic growth Identify and explain the dynamic interactions between energy
markets, as well as describe the importance of institutional and
organisational relationships for the effectiveness of energy
markets Analyse power markets based on load duration curves, screening
curves and cost recovery of power plants Describe the relation between investments and generation
capacity, as well as the effects produced by capacity remunerations
models such as capacity markets. Describe different environmental valuation methods and compare
their applicability for energy projects Describe the link between energy economics and environmental
economics and how they can be used to understand economic aspects
and challenges in a sustainable energy system Analyse effects and interactions between different regulation
methods, such as taxes and tradable quotas (pros and cons of
different regulation methods under different assumptions) Analyse and compare consequences for renewable energy
technologies of different support schemes and other forms of direct
regulation Describe regulatory and policy choices, e.g. with regard to
energy savings measures or environmental policy, and assess their
consequences Present and discuss an academic paper or article within the
abovementioned fields","
This course takes the approach of microeconomics to analyse the
energy sector, how energy markets behave and the necessary
regulation of markets.

The course provides a general introduction to the energy sector
both at the national and at the international level. The main focus
will be on different types of energy markets (electricity, oil,
gas, emissions, etc.). This encompasses market design, market
interactions as well as potential market imperfections. These
subjects will be analysed and discussed under consideration of
externalities, environmental taxes, quantitative regulation and
market power. We discuss policy measures to address these aspects
under different conditions.

The teaching is partially based on an introductory textbook in
environmental economics. Further, book chapters as well as
scientific papers and articles dealing with the respective subject
will be introduced and discussed.

feasibility and bankability results by creating appropriate
scenarios and sensitivity analyses Formulate specific recommendations for decision makers based on
results from a feasibility study Reflect on advantages and limitations that a partial and more
or less isolated analysis of a single project has as compared to a
more comprehensive energy system analysis","
We introduce the concepts of basic economic valuation, investment
analysis, levelised costs of energy, assessment of environmental
impacts, sensitivity and risk analysis, and financing of projects.
In lectures, exercises and group work the students gradually learn
how to create project valuation models and perform feasibility
studies. Throughout the course, students work on a real life case
from the energy industry, for which they elaborate a comprehensive
feasibility report. The course shall prepare students towards the
end of their Master studies to navigate in a professional work
environment that demands skills in both engineering and economics,
e.g. as in project management.

The aim of the course is to gain understanding and insight as well
as to attain practical competencies in the area of technology
analysis (theory and methods) with respect to the mutual process of
shaping between design and use of artifacts. The course introduces
an expanded repertoire of analytical tools from the new sociology
of technology as well as cultural studies, in relation to the
pre-requisite course 42011. The new analytical and methodological
approach is to facilitate the characterisation, problematisation
and analysis of artifacts as heterogeneous co-constructions.

The course's treatment includes a recognition of the
philosophical basis of such analysis and its relevance in the
context of analysing products and technology, drawing upon elements
from the Theory of Science in Engineering. The course will herby
also treat the interrelationships between codifiable and practical
knowledge, as well as qualifications vis-a-vis competences in the
knowledge practices of engineers. 
","Apply Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and pertinent methods in the
analysis of technologies and products. Characterise products and their attributes as heterogeneously
ordered, hybrid constructions, through a broad conception of
products and technology. Identify and unravel the hybrid dimensions of a product, in
concrete contexts, through the notions of distributed agency and
knowledge processes as relates to boundary objects. Describe how knowledge is structured and ordered in the
respective cases of specialised knowledge vis-a-vis in situ domains
of engineering work practices. Account for heterogenous engineering, and the role played by
framing, in engineering design thinking and practice. Address basic issues concerning engineering science and the
status of objects, as relates to the Thoery of Science in
Engineering. Undertake original empirical research with a problem
orientation that is pertinent for a range of interrelated
design-use issues. Analyse the visions, as well as work of boundary-drawing, which
have had bearing on a product's shaping and use. Identify concrete aspects of heterogeneous translation, which
may be problematised as being of consequence to the product's
use, meaning and potential for reconceptualisation. Apply the attained knowledge on technology analysis and design
processes as a basis for a synthesis-oriented, creative approach to
design.","
The course entails an introduction to Actor-Network Theory (ANT),
with emphasis on the mutual ordering of needs, functionality and
meaning. The course focuses on the process of technology's
shaping: which includes design visions, product materialisation,
market emergence and product usage. The course involves exemplary
studies of design-use relationships, in the cultural and historical
contexts which products are embedded, and which serve to constitute
the emergence of products, their continued sustenance, and possible
state of obsolescence.

The following topics are covered in the course:

• Translation processes, including simplifications/​juxtapositions
as well as network punctualisations.

• Network displacement and differentiation of network states,
through reversible black-boxing.

• The product script through inscription and de-scription processes
in design and use..

• Boundary objects as elements in networks of knowledge practices.

• Use contexts, use processes, and user configruations.

• Domestication and product life thinking in an ANT perspective.

• The localisation of products in time, space and everyday life.

• Path-dependency and path-creation in the early stages of design.

• Product-market relationships (including institutions) as
heterogeneously ordered co-constructions.

• Objects and science in engineering practie and design.

• Heterogeneous engineering.

The aim of the course is to enable the students to analyse and
interpret developments in society (sub-culture, user groups,
technology etc.) and translate them into frames for developing new
products and technologies. The conceptual frame for this comprise
of the development arena which is described by actors and spaces.
The analysis of the development arena and the understanding of
existing path's of development/trajectories and actor worlds
form the basis for outlining possible scenarios that will act as
pointers in the analysis of the potential of the concept.

The conceptual framework for considering solutions is a concept
that should have its raison d´etre in a need- and market dimension
(idea with) as well as a technical realization dimension (idea in).
Furthermore, a concept must represent a new solution with a
significant and markedly improved content compared to the existing.

The course contains an introduction to the development space – the
arena – where the examined development takes place. The development
arena is introduced as a method for describing the space of actors,
social relations, technologies, institutions and artifacts, in
which a development process takes place.

The course builds on the students’ insight and skills in creative
problem solving from previous projects in the education. The course
introduces methods for concept creation which involves user
understanding, the significance of interaction between the
different sides of a product; the expanded product concept and
description of technology choice and technological platforms. A
case will be introduced so as to draft its development arena.

The course is organized as two successive sub-themes, covering
development arenas, creation of concepts for new products and
systems. For each sub-theme we will go through the theories with
examples over several sessions, followed by exercises where the
students based on various examples on applications as well as on
own contributions will discuss the methods and present them to each
other and the teachers.

The course is organized with theory teaching in the first weeks.
After that the theory is worked up from examples and themes, where
the students through project work identify the actual and relevant
development arenas and create innovative and attractive concepts.
The first two assignments result in written reports while the third
will be based on a synopsis and be reported to the teachers and
other groups with an oral presentation based on posters and
physical models.

With the course, we aim to prepare future designers, engineers and
managers for the way product development practice interacts with
the organization at large. We introduce students to a number of
relevant models, theories and methods that organizations use to
structure and manage their product development and innovation
efforts. More specifically, we focus on a number of modern
approaches and methods - such as agile development and user
experience design - that manufacturing companies are taking up in
order to drive their innovation efforts and overall competitiveness
and that are shaping the future of product development practice.
Furthermore, we aim to equip students with the capability to link
and use theoretical models and methods in the reality of product

processes. The course will enable students to analyse, select,
develop and test techniques/tools for the active involvement of
practitioners in real or simulated design processes. The focus will
be on approaches such as user-driven innovation, participatory
design, participatory innovation and co-creation. The students
should reflect on the different approaches' significance with
respect to staged dialogue, the further design process and its
outcome. The course will give students a broad foundation for
involving, staging and facilitating processes in which different
actors are involved in interdisciplinary dialogue, in front-end

product is a matter of obvious interest. Yet, this narrow
definition ignores the multiple ways in which commodities and
technologies become not only suspended between, but also effective
upon the vast array of actors (suppliers, consumers, regulators,
producers, infrastructures, etc.) which, in a broader sense of the
word, constitute their market. The course will enable the students
to think strategically about this broader involvement as an
integral part of a design process rather than as a disconnected
afterlife of a product. The course is based on a combination of
empirical examples and a basic introduction to relevant economic,

The course aims to equip students for real world engineering design
problems where one design method is often insufficient to
adequately address a problem. The application and synthesis of a
wide range of advanced design methods prepares the student to not
only react effectively to complex changing problems but also to
effectively plan, manage and improve the overall process.

The course brings together a student’s existing and new design
knowledge in order to tackle a real world design challenge. This
will take two main forms: Synthesising and applying multiple design
methods in a cohesive process; Understanding, applying and
reflecting on advanced design methods in the context of a real
world project.

TRIZ and DSM Communicate the use of, and reflection on, design methods and
process in the form of an analytical report","
This course brings together specific design methods as well as the
design process by applying them to a real world engineering design
problem.

In the beginning of the course a design brief from industry will be
presented. The students will form groups in which they will address
the brief by:

1) Designing a process utilising a range of concrete design
methods, adapted to the given problem.

2) Execute the design task by following, reflecting on and
improving the proposed process.

The students will be evaluated on their use of methods, the
process, the product, and the students’ ability to reflect on and
actively improve their working process.

In order to support this, the students are taught a range of
advanced design methods for each of the phases in the product
development process. Furthermore, the students are taught how to
fit the methods together into an appropriate process flow and
critically reflect on and improve both the methods and the overall
process.

The main prerequisite for this course is having read and being
familiar with:

The course will cover the advanced methods and tools that are being
developed, and are beginning to be used in transport modeling.
Specific focus will be on activity-based demand models of passenger
transport. The goal of these models is to construct better and more
detailed forecasts of transport demand in order to support mobility
and transport of people in cities and regions. There is a general
tendency to planners seeking transport models that are more
detailed in the sense that they must thus be able to handle
multiple choices, operating detailed in time and space and can be
used to describe a wide range of policies. This requires data,
estimation and a strategy for how to implement these models. The
course aims at providing the student knowledge about how these more
detailed models can be constructed and the dilemmas associated with
them. Another principal objective is to support the students'
ability to work independently and think analytically. The course
will therefore work with a case where we use simulation and a
demand model to design a parking system. It will give the students
an insight in how to use simulation and how this may be linked with
demand models. 
","Explain the basic principles of activity-based modelling and
the dilemmas associated with such models. Describe and explain the various mathematical and statistical
models behind the activity-based modelling. Estimate models for destination and mode choice for

results and how these can be estimated. Understand how simulation is used in activity-based models of
transport demand. Be able to explain how simulation models can be designed,
calibrated and used to solve different problems. Use scenario analysis and cost-benefit calculations for
activity-based models by quantifying user benefits as a result of a
change of supply (eg. A change in the infrastructure or
taxation). Interpret and present results based on statistical analysis or
simulation. Interpret and present results from the literature.","
The course will contain element of statistics, econometrics and
simulation. This will include including theory related to the
estimation of models and theory related to model simulation. The
course will also be concerned with the design of dedicated
simulation models, which may be based on raw data input or model
output. Students are expected to acquire the theory and to use
these models in practice throughout the course by working and

Developing a new technology requires much more than an economical
cost-benefit analysis of production and performance. Many aspects
will influence the success of an emerging technology at its final
use stage.

In this course we study how we can assess the potentials and
pitfalls of emerging technologies to optimize their development
process.

We define this “Sustainable Innovation process” as a directed
process of balanced consideration of the influencing aspects to
optimally guide the development of an emerging technology. The
process involves a.o.:

- Actor network analysis of the many entities that can influence
the technological field

- Analysis of governance and development of regulations and
legislation in the field

- Life cycle check of the technology, and paths for optimizing the
lifecycle to reduced footprint.

- Resource supply security and forecasts of involved materials.

- Toxicological aspects and ecotoxicological aspects

- The historical development in the field and the fundamental
limitations on performance, ,

- Competing technologies and future market analysis 
","Develop an appropriate method to perform a technology
assessment of a chosen (emerging) product/technology and assess its
potential advantages and drawbacks based on the limited available
information. This will be done through appropriate weighting of the
following points: Perform an actor-network analysis concerning the involved
parties and how they can influence the technological area Perform a life cycle check of the technology and analyse paths
for environmental optimisation of this a.o. collect new information
and perform a basic life cycle screening of the technology in
relation to competing options Perform an analysis of ""governance"" and development
of regulation and legislation within the field, and discuss social
and environmental advantages and risks of the new technology, and
relate to examples of these aspects Investigate supply security and supply horizons of the necassry
ressources Provide an overview of basic risk factors for the
technology's human and eco-toxicology in the perspective of
former historical and potential future consequences cf.
precautionary principle Explain the historical development of the chosen technology and
the underlying limitations Provide an overview of competing technologies and make a future
qualitative market analysis Evaluate the quality of the gathered data and evaluate how
uncertainties and assumptions affect the results and
conclusions Work in a group on performing the technology assessment and
describe the results in a report which can be handed over to
interested stakeholders. Present and defend your work, and perform
an individual peer review of others reports.","
This course aims at giving you experience in performing an analysis
involving a combination of these aspects in order to optimize the
success of a product innovation process.

Taking micro- and nanotechnology, and other technologies, as a case
of a rapidly evolving technological field, we study example cases
of sustainable innovation, combined with state-of-art literature to
give an overview of the methods being applied to guide the
development.

You will then formulate your own project and work in groups on a
selected case of emerging technology, and during the course present
your analysis in a presentation and report. The aim is to account
for your choice of method and then to formulate a substantiated
recommendation for optimal development of the technology you have
been investigating. The presentation can be used for Grøn Dyst as
well.

The project cases will typically be based on an industrial
collaborator, a research project, or a technology you find
interesting in surveying to locate new potentials for innovation
and development, maybe even in your further study and work after
the course.

The course hence gives a functional introduction and hands-on
experience for performing basic actor network analysis, life cycle
screening, and technology assessments, but given the time
constraints it will not give a full in-depth explanation on these
methods.

Sustainability is increasingly becoming an important issue for
companies. Several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals target
industry activities directly, and others count on the active
involvement of industry to develop solutions and products that can
help meet the goals. Many companies have hence come to understand
that their responses to the challenges of e.g. climate change
issues and an array of other issues on the sustainability agenda
are linked to their competitive advantage, that they can become an
essential part of the solution rather than the problem. Company
efforts e.g. to ensure that suppliers in emerging markets provide
safe working conditions for their employees are increasingly seen
as investments since companies that score high on sustainability
performance are generally more attractive for investors than other
companies. While the global challenges related to sustainability
are manifest, defining how businesses can meet the challenges can
be daunting. Sustainability can encompass a broad range of issues
that affect business — from pollution and climate change to
education, poverty, health and human rights. It involves a
connected world with a broad range of stakeholders—from employees
and communities to governments and NGOs. Operating sustainably is a
mindset with a focus on the creation of long-term shareholder
value. That means adhering to the fundamental tenets of good
entrepreneurship — identifying the changing needs and demands of
society, and responding with successful business models. Business
leaders who operate sustainably recognise that social,
environmental, economic and ethical factors affect their core
business strategies. The course will prepare future DTU engineers
to understand the sustainability challenges in relation to their
future work as technical experts or managers, making sustainable
development operational for the company that employs them.

Engineers are educated to design new technologies, processes,
organizations and systems. However, studies show that when they are
to be implemented problems arise, which affects effeciency,
productivity, costs and employee well-being. The primary goal of
the course is to provide the students an understanding of the
mechanisms and challenges related to implementation of techlogies,
processes, etc.

Implementation typically takes place while the daily operation must
be maintained. This means that there are limited resources, which
should be taken into account already in development and planning
process. An important part of the implementation is to ensure that
the implemented work as intended and often performance measurement
and incentive structures are used for this. Examples include
customer and employee satisfaction surveys, key performance
indicators for employees and managers, as well as wage and benefit
plans. One challenge is that there is not always consistency
between what is being measured and what the desired outcome is. The
course will therefore equip the students to analyze and design
performance management systems so that the system has a practical
effect on managers 'and employees' behavior. Furthermore,
the student are given understanding of the relationship between
performance management systems and the company's strategy and
results.

understanding of the management tasks related to planning and
execution of industrial production. Using examples from production
companies it is the aim of the course to enable students to
describe and analyse the production task of a company and to
develop a production system which can handle the production task of
the company. The course will focus partly on the physical
production, partly on the preparation of production by using
specifications for production.

The term “production” is in this connection to be understood in a
wide sense and comprises many kinds of production, e.g. the
production of electronics, IT, mechanics, chemistry and
construction. Therefore, this course is of relevance for all
programmes.

The course aims partly at giving students a basic understanding of
the development and preparation of production, including an
introductory knowledge of the management tasks related to
production in production companies, partly to give a professional
background for the further courses within the focus area of
operations management.

This course encompasses engineering and organisational change
management in the context of engineering systems. It enables
students to learn how to manage change processes and how to
navigate individual, organisational, inter-organisational, and
extended enterprise perspectives. This is achieved by introducing
theories and models to diagnose, plan, implement, evaluate and
sustain changes in, among and beyond organisations and by
developing action strategies in relation to specific cases.

backed-up guidance for possible solutions search for literature and write an article","
The course covers theories and models for the whole cycle(s) of
change processes in engineering systems, from identifying the need
for change, to diagnosing, planning, implementing, reviewing and
sustaining change processes and emphasises design and network
thinking for change. Specific examples are presented through guest
lectures from a number of institutions, documented cases, and
company cases which participants find themselves.

Changes riddle an organisation. We observe them and we are part of
them. Every change, big or small, has an impact. To ensure
continuous 'fitness for purpose' and enable foresight, we
need to adapt and so do organisations. Organisations evolve in
accordance with their own vision, mission, strategies and
operations. To abandon this orientation in the face of every change
would be costly and could result in imbalances. Too sluggish a
response, however, would also be costly. As the rate of change is
increasing, we are confronted with an ever-greater need to manage
both incremental and transformational changes. While searching to
find the right balance between following well-known ways and
walking undiscovered paths, we might need to reprioritise, which,
in turn, might tell us to reorganise and recreate.

Balmorel is a linear optimization model of a power system including
district heating systems. The model is an open source model and
available on a home page along with a full model description and
documentation of analyses (www.balmorel.com). Balmorel has been
used for a wide range of analyses documented in project reports
available on the model website and in journal papers. Based on the
assumption that perfect market conditions exist the model minimizes
system costs, consisting of operational costs and annualized
investment costs. Operational costs include fuel costs, CO2 quota
costs as well as operation and maintenance costs. Taxes are not
included in this analysis. Given a number of restrictions, the
model may optimize investments in new production as well as
transmission capacity and the operation of plants. Prices such as
the electricity price can be found from the marginal values of
restrictions. The model is designed to cover several countries.
Each country consists of one or more regions, between which
electricity exchange is restricted due to limited transmission
capacities. Each region, in turn, consists of one or more district
heating areas, between which no exchange of heat is allowed. Time
series for electricity demand and wind power production are given
for regions, whereas time series for heat demand are given for
areas. The time series provide hourly data for one year.

To address the increasing need for methods to assess impacts of
toxic chemical emissions on human health and ecosystems, this
course aims at providing a practical overview of multimedia
chemical fate modeling, multi-pathway human exposure modeling,
ecosystem and human health effects modeling, and comparative
indicators for human-toxicological and ecotoxicological impacts. We
begin by explaining basic concepts of environmental mass balance
modeling - including partitioning coefficients, first order rate
coefficients, cross-media transport, and persistence. We next
present the fundamentals of multi-pathway models for human intake
via inhalation, drinking water and food. We will review
hazard-based and risk-based effects modeling approaches that are
used to assess effect factors and illustrate how fate, exposure,
effect and damage factors can be combined to construct factors to
characterize chemical emissions. We then guide the participants
through a series of examples in which they will develop
characterization factors for human-toxicological and
ecotoxicological impacts using the latest release version of the
USEtox scientific consensus model. Participants will explore USEtox
as a tool for comparative assessment of chemical fate, exposure,
and effects. We will conclude with several hands-on exercises of
how the model can be used in various applications, including the
prioritization and ranking of chemicals for institutions like the
European Commission or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

42714 , Decision Theory,English , 5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,Fall  or  Spring,Ph.D.,DTU Management Engineering,"
Decision theory has received a tremendous research interest across
the scientific disciplines. Decision theory investigates the
mathematical and probabilistic relations and its quantitative
representation in order optimize the utility of decisions. Decision
analysis provides the decision maker an instrument that leads to an
objective and transparent choice and justification of alternatives.
The foundations of decision analysis in terms of utility theory
were firstly defined in a set of axioms stated by Von Neumann and
Morgenstern (1947). Raiffa and Schaifer (1961) introduced the
decision theory providing rational and theoretical feasibility to
each phase of the decision problem.

The course will cover theory and practice of decision making under
uncertainty covering the foundations up to recent developments and
applications in the fields of civil engineering, management and the
ones which are represented by the course participants. This course
is organized by the GDSI – Global Decision Support Initiative at
DTU Management.

A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:

","Provide an overview about the foundations of decision
theory Provide an overview about relevant literature on and
application of decision theory Structure the decision problem for application in his/her
specific field of interest Use decision trees and influence diagrams Assess and model utilities Quantify and model uncertainties related to the phases of the

42995 , Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and project appraisal,Danish , 10 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,F5B (Wed 13-17) and June,BEng,DTU Management Engineering,"
The course provides the students with an overview of the
technologies and methods used within intelligent transport systems
(ITS). The students will be able to understand the importance of
ITS and make use of ITS technologies to achieve an efficient
utilization of the infrastructure, both for public and individual
transport. Furthermore, the course povides the students with a
project assessment-related theoretical and practical basis for
socio-economic appraisal of transport infrastructure projects. In
the main project of the course the students will be asked to
design, model and build an ITS solution for a specific transport
infrastructure problem and subsequently to produce a socio-economic
assessment of the solution proposal. 
","Know how ITS can contribute to design and control of transport
systems Understand the concept and application of ITS technologies
within sensors, positioning, communication, IT and data
processing Understand how ITS solutions can assist in solving problems in
traffic and improve already existing transport systems within
public as well as individual road traffic including ITS for user
information and for improving traffic flow Use ITS solutions and establish overall frameworks for the
technologies used Understand and describe the use of socio-economic analyses of
transport infrastructure projects Use the basic principles from socio-economic analysis by the
means of cost benefit analysis applied to transport infrastructure
projects Analyse suitable parameters and variables made use of within
socio-economic analyses of transport infrastructure projects Analyse available data based on a qualitative as well as on a
quantitative approach and perform a socio-economic analysis Assess the socio-economic analysis framework and solution
methods Analyse and construct a small-scale ITS project for public
and/or individual traffic and as part hereof describe the need for
- and collect and select - relevant data Assess the pros and cons of the proposed ITS solution and
techonology and reflect upon the societal, socio-economic and
operational economic aspects associated to the proposed
solution","
The course introduces the students to the following subjects within
ITS; technologies used within ITS including positioning, sensors,
communication, IT and data processing. The architecture of ITS
systems will discussed and the discipline “systems engineering” is
introduced. ITS for road traffic is being discussed including
algorithms for improving traffic flow, variable/dynamic boards,
highway systems, ITS for road construction works and traffic
information services. ITS systems within public transport systems
to improve the travel speed and the level of information to the
customers are discussed.

Furthermore, the course treats the basic theory and methodology in
appraisal of a transport infrastructure project. The main objective
is for the students' to be able to apply cost-benefit analysis
(CBA) and multi-criteria analysis (MCDA) on a particular
transportation case project. The students are introduced to
socio-economic assessment by the use of various software solutions.
These includes the TERESA model from the Danish Ministry of
Transport.

In the final part of the course (given in the 3 week period in
June) the students will produce a small-scale ITS project set in a
""Smart Cities"" context. The project chosen is to be
specified, planned and designed (conceptually). Subsequently,
relevant data is collected and selected for use in building a
prototype test. The prototype is implemented and tested. Finally,
the students will assess the socio-economic impacts of the proposed
project.

The course practices self-dependence and professional maturity by
training the students’ ability to work independently with all
phases of a traffic and transport project. The course collects and
summarizes the experiences gained by the students during their
traineeships and prepares them to work independently with the
bachelor thesis. The project is carried out by the students
individually and is prepared throughout the semester. 
","Delimit a complex and open traffic and transport-related
problem and formulate a working hypothesis, including the
establishment of subject-specific project goals Prepare a detailed time and work plan, including clear subgoals
for the project Run the project according to the time and work plan and update
the plan when needed Have an ongoing and constructive dialogue with the
subject-specific supervisor, including the preparation of
sufficient material prior to the meetings with the tutor Seek and evaluate the relevance of technical information and
use it in the project Pursue and answer the subject-specific goals of the
project Discuss ethical issues and use his/her professional ethics in
connection with a specific issue Apply and evaluate technological solutions based on the
principle of ethics and sustainability Identify his/her own strengths and weaknesses with respect to
personal, social and generic professional skills as well as
subject-specific engineering competences in order to use/handle
them adequately Report the results obtained in a structured, complete, concise,
clear and critically evaluating/concluding way in accordance with
good practice for writing reports within the field of work Defend the report by means of an oral presentation and
participate in a detailed discussion of the critics of the report
prepared","
The course is structured as a direct follow-up to the traineeship
carried out in connection with the Bachelor of Engineering
programme in Traffic and Transport; during the first weeks the
course focuses partly on summarizing the knowledge gained by the
students during their traineeships and partly on information
search. Afterwards, the course concentrates on a specific problem
regarding traffic and transport planning which the student would
like to work with. The problem can be inspired by problems treated
or encountered by the student during the first four semesters of
the study or a subject studied by the student during his/her
traineeship.

The students will work with a major traffic and transport project
embracing all phases, including problem delimitation, literature
search, methodology, troubleshooting, testing, evaluation of
results and written and oral reporting. Each student is given a
supervisor who can advise the student on subject-oriented matters
as well as process-oriented matters throughout the project period.
The student's ability to meet the learning objectives with
regards to the process-oriented matters will be evaluated through
the use of documentation prepared by the student during the project
period and include elements such as the project delimitation, the
time and work plans etc.

The course is evaluated both in terms of the prepared report and
the oral exam. The reports as well as the oral exam is evaluated by
the supervisor attached to the specific student and by the
programme coordinator of the study programme

context of rapid change Formulate sound corporate strategy","
The course is built on three pillars: strategic positioning,
capabilities, and change. Starting from the analysis of the firm’s
external competitive environment, we assess the “structural”
attractiveness of the relevant industry and consider how a firm’s
position in that industry affects its performance. Then shifting
focus internally to an analysis of the firm’s resources and
capabilities, we explore how competitive advantage is built and
sustained. Finally, we turn to organizational change to explore
what happens when a company’s environment changes and, in
particular, how the organization’s behavioral context both
facilitates and constrains our ability to put strategy into action.
