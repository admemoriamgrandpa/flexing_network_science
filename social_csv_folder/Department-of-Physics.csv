Detailed understanding of the atomic scale structure and dynamics
of materials is a crucial prerequisite for understanding their
physical properties, and therefore also for the design of new
materials of technological interest. Neutron and X-ray scattering
are complementary methods that find broad application within
physics, chemistry, biology and materials science. Using a series
of experimental techniques, which will be introduced during the
course, neutron and X-ray scattering allow the determination of all
relevant structural parameters for molecules and crystals as well
as amorphous materials, including also the magnetic structure.
Furthermore, elementary excitations of the relevant lattice and
magnetic degrees of freedom such as (phonons and spin waves) can be
studied in great detail. Imaging with x-rays and neutrons enables
structural characterization locally within the material. The
overall goal of the course is to provide a broad understanding of
modern X-ray and neutron scattering, and a thorough introduction to
the practical use of these techniques in the study of the structure
and dynamics of materials. The importance of neutron and x-ray
scattering is underscored by the very large investments currently
being made by the Danish state in the construction of the European
Spallation Source (ESS) and MAX-IV in Lund, Sweden, and in the
European XFEL in Hamburg, Germany. The Technical University of
Denmark is strongly involved in instrument design and construction
at all three facilities. 
","Describe methods for production of X-ray and neutron
beams. Discuss how nuclei and electrons interact with neutrons and
X-ray photons. Illustrate the principles behind structure determination with

lattice and magnetic dynamics. Calculate scattering and absorption cross-sections as well as
dynamic structure factors quantitatively. Identify the principles behind basic experimental techniques
for studies of structure and dynamics. Illustrate how Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations can be used
in the design and optimization of instruments, including
optics. Argue for the complementarity between X-ray and neutron
scattering. Explain how the study of physical processes on certain
characteristic time and length scales dictates the choice of
certain instrument-types at either neutron or X-ray
facilities. Formulate an application for beam-time based on knowledge of
existing and future neutron and X-ray facilities and
instruments.","

structure and dynamics of materials and the associated scattering
phenomena, which can be observed at international neutron and X-ray
facilities , such as ILL and ESRF in Grenoble, France, and the
upcoming facilities ESS, MAX-IV and European XFEL. The student is
introduced to key concepts such as cross-sections, scattering
factors, absorption, diffraction, spectroscopy and fluorescence.

blade design Present the project results on a poster and explain it in
detail","
This course will build on the Design-Build 1 course of the first
semester and further introduce the students to the CDIO concepts.
The problem to be solved in this course is related to wind energy
harvesting, i.e. efficient conversion of wind kinetic energy into
electrical energy. Given a wind turbine setup and electrical
generator, the part to be optimized is the form of the wind blades.

 Based on some introductory lectures, the students will design and
manufacture their own wind turbine with a 3D printer and measure
the resulting energy conversion efficiency as a function of wind
speed. To this end, interdisciplinary student teams will be formed
with special consideration for the required skills/competencies
needed for the problem.

 Given the time constraints of the 3-weeks course, special emphasis
will be put on the development of an efficient project plan with
appropriate time management. These plans will be presented and
peer-reviewed during the course.

 Besides for their overall efficiency, the blades can (if time
permits) also be evaluated for their durability under heavy wind
load. Another optional subproject could be the deconvolution of the
individual part’s efficiencies, e.g. the influence of the
electrical generator. Data collection will be performed in
available setups in Nanoteket, where it is possible for interested
students to dive further into computer based data acquisition based
on LabView.

 Finally, the project plan, blade design and measured data will be
presented on a poster. This poster will be the basis of the final,
summative assessment, where each group member should be able to
defend the entire poster.

 Additionally, a competition will be held with prices for the best
wind blade design (highest achieved energy conversion efficiency)
and the poster with the best communication of the content.

Spooky quantum effects such as quantum superposition and
entanglement are now being used to develop radically new
technologies with far-reaching applications, including super-secure
communication, a new paradigm for computing (quantum computing),
and sensors with unpreceedented sensitivty for e.g. biomedical
imaging. This is a true technological revolution and thus
companies, like Google and Microsoft, are investing substantially
in this new technology.

The goal of this course is to experimentally explore some of these
technologies with focus on quantum optical technology. This
includes an understanding of the production, the detection and the
characterization of quantum states. A special focus will be put on
how to deal with unavoidable technical noise sources, present in
all implementations, which disturb quantum effects. 
","Explain the different techniques used in a particular quantum
technology Characterize the properties of a parametric down-conversion
source Account for technical noise sources present in experiments Implement a data acquisition system Perform quantum state tomography Discuss landmark experiments in quantum optics Perform correlation analysis of photon detection Organize, plan and carry out collaborative work in group
projects","
The course introduces the student to experimental techniques for
generating quantum states based on particle properties of light
(single photons) using a parametric-down conversion source. We will
detect the generated quantum states with single photon detection,
thereby learning the fundamental detection principle and their
associated noise sources.

We will experimentally characterize the quantum states by
performing quantum state tomography. Properties of photon pairs
will be studied by the famous Hong-Ou-Mandel and
Hanbury-Brown-Twiss experiments.

Implementing applications of quantum technology is possible.
Special emphasis will be put on technical details an
experimentalist has to deal with when demonstrating theoretical
quantum optical predictions and when making use of those in
practical measurement devices. The student is, thus, introduced to
cutting-edge technological challenges faced by quantum engineers.

position, velocity, and acceleration is treated, and invariant

energy-momentum conservation is applied to elastic scattering (the
Compton effect). Relativistic Doppler effect is treated, followed
by a relativistic description of plane waves, the 4-vector phase,
the group and phase velocity, and the propagation in and index of
refraction of a moving medium. Finally, elements of relativistic

course includes some experimental work. The computations may be
carried out on the students own computers or on a computer cluster.
The course consists of the following elements: (i) Lectures
(details about the Monte-Carlo code EGSnrc and the theoretical
basis for radiation dosimetry), (ii) Studying literature related to
the project problem (e.g. research papers), (iii) Obtaining
physical parameters for the computations, (iv) Modelling and
measurements, and (v) Report writing.
