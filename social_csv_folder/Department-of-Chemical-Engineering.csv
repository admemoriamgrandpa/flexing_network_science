To enable the students to formulate and solve mathematical models
for chemical systems such as they occur in chemical and
biotechnological process equipment. 
","Draw a simple figure of a chemical engineering system based on
the available description, and point out important simplifying
assumptions, including the proper system boundaries. Decide if a process is stationary or non-stationary, and decide
if concentrations, temperature and pressure vary internally in the
system, all in consideration of the simplifying assumptions. Choose dependent and independent variables for model set-up and
decide if a differential or an integral control volume has to be
used, choose shape of control volume based on system geometry, and
distinguish between system and control volume. Account for the four different terms in mass and energy (heat)
balances for the control volume and state which processes in the
system contribute to each of those terms. Formulate mass and heat balances for both differential and
integral control volumes, and use expressions for transport
processes, be it in the form of convective contributions or as flux
expressions. Convert balances (in different geometries) to differential
equations, and specify boundary and/or initial conditions based on
the system description. Formulate mathematical expressions for system characterizing
quantities defined verbally. Transform a raw model to dimensionless form by normalizing
variables and variable expressions, and afterwards explain and
interpret the appearing dimensionless parameters in relation to
system behavior. Examine concurrently with the modeling process if a model is
clearly in error. Use mathematical methods from the prerequisite mathematics
course and technical aids of own choice to solve differential
equation models, including the use of Bessel functions as
intermediate quantities. Analyze, explain and predict the behavior of modeled systems,
including defining steady states and examining those for
stability. Do all of the above on simple partial differential equation
models, including using the separation of variables method and
basic results of Sturm-Liouville theory to express solutions in
series form.","
A mathematical model is a set of equations describing the behaviour
of a real system, and how the behaviour may be influenced by
external stimuli. A mathematical model enables the engineer to
design a process, to optimize designs, and to control the resulting
working process.

The formulation of a mathematical model is based on the following
principal elements: Conservation of mass and energy, known
relations between transport rates and physico-chemical conditions
(flow, diffusion, conduction, mass and heat transfer), and
knowledge about the concentration and temperature dependence of the
rates of the involved chemical reactions.

Based on examples the course covers

- choice of control volume,

- steady and non-steady state differential mass and energy
balances,

- formulation of boundary conditions through balance equations,

- fluxes,

- transport through variable control volume surfaces,

- linearization and stability

with the intent of exploring the interaction between different
transport mechanisms as well as between chemical reaction and
transport of mass and heat.

decision to study the feasibility of process alternatives followed
by a preliminary design, a conceptual design, and after several
more stages, ends with the commissioning of the designed process.
In this course, the stages dealing with preliminary design and
conceptual design will be covered. In the preliminary design,
emphasis will be given on how to generate and evaluate data
(information) and on how to make simple calculations for
preliminary design decisions and economic analysis. In the
conceptual design, emphasis will be given to process integration
(such as heat integration), pollution prevention and waste
minimization in addition to computer-aided techniques for process
synthesis and design. In addition, significance of instrumentation,
operability and safety will also be introduced. 
","Make design related decisions Use knowledge to solve practical engineering problems Analyze data Work in groups Use computer aided tools Generate and screen alternatives Verify and analyze simulation results Formulate process design problems and to develop systematic
solution strategies Apply chemical engineering principles learned from other
courses Apply ""green"" or environmental issues in process

The course will be divided into two parts. The first part will deal
with introduction to process design principles, the stages of the
process design life cycle and the preliminary design steps
(flowsheet synthesis, equipment sizing/costing, economic
evaluation, scheduling of batch operations, distillation sequences,
pinch analysis). The second part will deal with conceptual design
(advanced process synthesis (such as heat integration, heat
exchanger networks, reactor networks, reaction-separation
sequences, solvent selection), equipment selection, flowsheet
optimization). Emphasis will be given to evaluation of data with
respect to process design. Advanced topics such as mass
integration, waste minimization, pollution prevention through
better design, structural optimization and hazards/safety will also
be considered in this part. Special emphasis will be given to
solution of synthesis and design problems of interest to the
industry.

The lectures in the two sections will be supplemented by case
studies highlighting the design principles and the methods and
tools used to obtain the design. The methods and tools will include
both short-cut hand calculation techniques as well as state of the
art computer aided tools (such as commercial simulators and
in-house integrated computer aided systems).

28451 , Optimising Plantwide Control,English , 7.5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,F2A (Mon 13-17),MSc,Department of Chemical Engineering,"
Typical chemical plants may contain hundreds of measurements and
control loops. Most control theories (those you have seen in the
introduction to process control) assume that a control structure is
already given at the start, which reduces the problem to tuning and
calculation of a control law. In practice, however, given a plant
design with its process flow diagram, a control engineer faces the
following problems: i)Which variables should be controlled, ii)
which variables should be measured, iii) which inputs should be
manipulated, and iv) which links should be established between
them?’

These are the questions that the plantwide control course
addresses. To this end, a systematic methodology based on
hierarchial decomposition of the control problem into layers is
used for designing a plantwide control structure based on process
understanding. The performance of the control structure is then
evaluated and further refined using dynamic simulations of the
process in question in an iterative manner.

The goal of the course is thus to learn i) to manage the
complicated task of designing a control strategy for the entire
plant; ii) to understand process dynamics using dynamic
simulations; iii) to develop and implement a control strategy that
meets control design objectives (stabilize the system, optimize the
economics and satisfy the constraints); and vi) evaluation of
alternative solutions. Ultimately all these efforts are to help
develop and operate better, safer, and optimal processes for
chemical and biochemical industries. 
","Perform a systematic analysis of the operation of Chemical and
biochemical process plants Derive a control structure based upon the process analysis Calculate the optimal point of operation for the control

system Design multivariable PID control structures Formulate and design model based multivariable controllers,
incl. LQR, LQG and MPC Evaluate controller's performance using simulation and
dynamic process model","
The course base is the synthesis of the plant and its derived
operational goals which illustrate that process design and
operation are two sides of the same fundamental problem. Selection
of actuators and measurements for a basic control structure at the
single variable layer is introduced from a systematic model
analysis. In a subsequent synthesis step a pairing of actuators and
measurements is selected. How the operational goals may be achieved
in practice through control is illustrated for selected examples.
These examples will also demonstrate characteristic control
structures.

In order to design sustainable processes for the future, it is
essential to use advanced process technologies. It requires a
holistic and a systematic view on the process for a systematic
identification of (novel) advanced process technologies to be used
to match the individual challenges of the process. Because of the
potentially large range of topics that can be covered, a selection
of topics will be considered each year, based on the background of
the participants and the current state of the art. Some examples of
the topics are listed below: process technologies in biocatalysis;
process/unit operations integration; process intensification;
design of sustainable processes or processes based on Green
Engineering Principles; Scale translation; Process Analytical
Technology; Evaluation tools based on sustainability, economic
evaluation, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Design of experiments;
kinetics and reaction modeling; microfluidic application in
biotechnology; computational fluid dynamics (CFD); spectroscopic
methods for bioprocesses; etc. Each topic will be analysed in terms
of the generic problem to be addressed, the (available or
desirable) solution strategy (methodological, model-based,
experimental, etc.), necessary and desirable tools,
advantages/​disadvantages, limitations, application (operating)
window and testing of possible improvements.

Process design involves the solution of open-ended problems. The
design problem is first defined and then broken down into a set of
sub-problems (tasks) that are solved in a specified sequence. In
each task, a set of design decisions are made, analyzed and
verified. Therefore, the final process design and the path to
achieve it depend on the design decisions taken in each of the
design tasks. This means that there could be many process designs
for the defined design problem. In this course, the process design
problem solution is broken down into 12 design tasks, to be
performed in a specific sequence.
