13150 , Transport economics,English , 5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,F1A (Mon 8-12),MSc,Department of Transport,"
The course is intended as an overview of transport economics. A
solid introduction to basic micro economic theory will be provided
as well. The course covers contemporary transportation issues such
as transport demand analysis, firm production and costs in
transportation, market behaviour, social costs, and impact and
welfare analysis. The course does not focus on a specific
transportation mode but uses the various modes to apply the
theoretical and analytical concepts presented in the lectures and
readings. We concentrate on both basic material and theory models
and on selected topics dealing with contemporary issues of
transportation policy such as pricing and regulation. Finally the
course provides an understanding of the economist's approach to
evaluating transport investments or transport programs, i.e. the
cost-benefit analysis (CBA). 
","Explain the fundamental principles behind the transport
economics Analyse transport demand Analyse transport costs structures Analyse transport policy reforms Analyse market power and efficiency in transportation Evaluate the effects on welfare of transport pricing Use models to welfare-analysis and cost-benefit analysis Argue concerning the usefulness of a specific model for a
specific problem Discuss a paper applying transport economics","
The course will include elements of micro economics and statistics.
The course introduces the microeconomic concepts central to
transportation systems. Topics covered include economic theory of
the firm, consumer choice behavior, cost models and production
function, market power in transportation, efficiency in
transportation, and cost-benefit analysis (CBA).

13400 , Simulation in Transportation and Logistics,English , 5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,F4A (Tues 13-17),MSc,Department of Transport,"
Discrete event-based simulation is a powerful tool often used
within transportation and logistics for analysis of performance and
robustness. The course will enable the students to design,
implement and use discrete event-based simulation models. 
","Explain the concept of discrete event-based simulation Design a discrete event-based simulation model Implement a discrete event-based simulation model Validate the proposed simulation model Design a simulation experiment Formulate relevant performance indicators Carry out a simulation experiment Analyse and assess simulation results Explain how external optimisation algorithms can be integrated
with the simulation model Present and discuss the implemented simulation model and the
results obtained through the experiments","
The course focuses on teaching the students to use discrete
event-based simulation models for analyses of problems within
transportation and logistics. Based upon a wide range of specific
complex planning problems it will be discussed how simulation
models can be used to obtain knowledge on the system's
operating performance. The students are taught to analyse complex
systems within transportation and logistics and to define relevant
Performance Indicators. Furthermore, it will be discussed how
simulation models and optimisation models can compliment each
other. The students are given an introduction to the simulation
modelling language Arena through a number of small-scale practical
assignments. Hereafter, the students are given a larger project in
which a specific simulation problem is solved.
