47311 , Analytical Imaging of Energy Materials by Electron Micrsocopy,English , 5 ECTS , 2016/2017 ,E5A (Wed 8-12),MSc,DTU,"
In renewable energy materials research and development, functional
materials have played and will continue to play an essential role
in the creation of tomorrow's energy devices. By their crystal
structure and elemental composition, functional materials e.g.
allow to convert sunlight to electricity, or to store electrical
energy as chemical energy in the form of hydrogen or other types of
fuels. The complicated physical and chemical processes are often
dependent on the local nano- and microstructure of the functional
components within energy devices. It is therefore essential to be
able to analyze these materials with advanced imaging techniques
that both give high resolution quantitative and qualitative data,
e.g. scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and
focused ion beam microscopy (FIB). The aim of the course is that
students will be able to understand and judge the usefulness of a
wide variety of SEM and TEM analysis techniques that are used by
industry and in research, and to be able to suggest suitable
imaging techniques to solve specific problems related to the
properties of functional energy materials.

microscopy (TEM) operating conditions for example by using
simulation software Prepare specimens for electron microscopy analysis and justify

and ex-situ versus in-situ electron microscopy investigations Perform a literature search to select a relevant scientific
article on the use of electron microscopy in the analysis of an
energy material and analyse, criticize and present the main
findings","
The course is based on a combination of theoretical lectures,
numerical and image-based exercises and case studies performed in
small project groups. The lectures provide the physical mechanisms
describing the interactions between electrons and solid state
energy materials and the foundations of microscopy-based analysis
techniques. The exercises will provide understanding of the
practised analysis techniques, and the case studies are based on
actual problems encountered in renewable energy materials. The
course provides students with the skills to analyze, explain and
conclude, with respect to state-of-the-art analysis techniques, and
with methodologies to solve specific problems within energy
materials. Reports based on the case studies will provide students

To design functionally graded materials,
nanomaterials/​nanocomposites, and thermoelectric materials for
energy conversion and storage, it requires advanced sintering
methods. Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is a new technique where it
only only a few minutes to complete a sintering process compared
with conventional sintering which may take hours or even days for
the same. Using SPS, near theoretical density can be obtained at
lower sintering temperature and in a shorter period of time than
other sintering processes. Importantly, with SPS nanostructures can
be maintained in a bulk form which has excellent mechanical
properties such as high strength, high hardness etc. Therefore, SPS
emerges as a key technology for a new generation of materials. This
course aims at providing students with insight into knowing how the
SPS sintering happens from the basic principles and mechanism to
the practical working experience.

In the context of this course, functional materials are defined as
solid materials that lower the activation energies of chemical
reactions (heterogenous catalysts) or as materials in
electrochemical systems that convert electrical energy to chemical
energy and vice versa. The functional materials typically operate
under conditions that include elevated temperatures, specific gas
compositions and possibly also electrical polarization. These
operating conditions affect the reactions that take place on the
material and also the state of the functional material itself. This
course deals with understanding why it is important to study the
functional materials at work (in situ) and how these studies can be
conducted with optical methods despite the challenging conditions.
While this course will focus primarily on vibrational spectroscopic
methods (Raman, FTIR), the principles will be general and other

required from a system point of view to operate it. The student
will also obtain a fair view on the difficulties that exist for the
individual types such as degradation mechanisms and demands for

basic principles of the operation of low-temperature fuel cells
(LTFC) and electrolysis cells (LTEC), will be able to describe the
requirements put forward on the materials, learn the principles of
the conduction mechanisms in the materials used for the main
components, will be able to describe theoretically and interpret
electrochemical processes occurring in LTFC and LTEC, will learn
about cell- and stack designs and manufacturing methods, will be
able to describe the main degradation mechanisms occurring in LTFC
and LTEC, and will understand critical issues in the selection of
materials and components for cells. Furthermore, the student will
come to know about the advantages and disadvantages of LTFC and
LTEC compared with other energy technologies, and will be
acquainted with various designs and their advantages and
disadvantages, as well as application areas. The student will gain
experience of characterization methods such as electrochemical
methods and structural analysis methods. In addition, the student
will in group work on own ideas on possible applications of LTFC
and/or LTEC.
